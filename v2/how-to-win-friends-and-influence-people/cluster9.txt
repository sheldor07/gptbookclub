## The Desire for Importance: What It Drives and Reveals about Us

It is undeniable that the desire for a feeling of importance holds significant influence over human behavior. This desire has fueled the creation of masterpieces, driven individuals to amass immense wealth, and even led some to engage in criminal activities. In understanding this desire, we gain insight into our character and what truly matters to us.

### The Creative Impetus

The desire for a feeling of importance has spurred great authors like Charles Dickens to write timeless novels. Dickens, motivated by this desire, crafted narratives that resonated with readers for generations to come. Similarly, the renowned architect Sir Christopher Wren sought to design awe-inspiring structures that would leave a lasting impact. This same desire to create something significant drove Wren to construct magnificent buildings that still stand as symphonies in stone.

### The Pursuit of Wealth

The desire for importance can manifest in the pursuit of material wealth, leading to unprecedented accumulation of resources. Look no further than the example of John D. Rockefeller, who amassed millions of dollars that he never even spent. It was this desire for a feeling of importance that propelled him to such astronomical financial success. Furthermore, even in our own towns, we may find families building houses far larger than necessary in an attempt to display their status and importance.

### Influence on Lifestyle Choices

The desire for feeling important often influences our choice of lifestyle. We may find ourselves drawn to the latest fashion trends, eagerly seeking to wear the most current styles. The same desire can extend to our choice of vehicles, as we strive to drive the latest cars to demonstrate our importance. Additionally, parents may become captivated by sharing their children's achievements, reflecting their own sense of importance through their brilliant offspring.

### The Dark Side

Unfortunately, the desire for importance can also lead to negative consequences. For some, this desire becomes a driving force for negative behavior, drawing them towards criminal activities. E. P. Mulrooney, former police commissioner of New York, has noted that many young criminals are motivated by ego. Their first request after arrest is often for newspapers that depict them as larger-than-life figures, like the sports stars, actors, and politicians they admire. This desire for a distorted sense of importance propels them into criminal activities, overshadowing the consequences they may face.

### The Key to Character

In understanding how we seek our feeling of importance, we can discern significant aspects of our character. The magnitude of this desire and what we prioritize in its pursuit reveal much about who we are as individuals. It is not our possessions or accomplishments that define us, but rather the underlying motivations and values that drive our quest for importance.

In summary, the desire for a feeling of importance is a powerful force that shapes our lives in various ways. It drives creativity and the pursuit of wealth, influences our lifestyle choices, and unfortunately, can lead some astray. Understanding this desire and what it reveals about our character enables us to navigate our lives with greater self-awareness, focusing on what truly matters to us as individuals.
