## Key Idea Identified: Lack of consideration for personal desires and insensitivity in communication

# Text:
The key idea behind these paragraphs is the lack of consideration for personal desires and insensitivity in communication. In the first paragraph, the author expresses their frustration towards the recipient's focus on their desires and the President's desires, without acknowledging their own desires. 

Moving on, in the second paragraph, the author is offended by the recipient's request to put their company on a 'preferred list' without using the word 'please.' The recipient's big talk about their company makes the author feel insignificant, leading to a sense of irritation. 

In the third paragraph, the author expects a prompt acknowledgment of their letter, emphasizing that it would be mutually helpful. However, the recipient's lack of response is seen as inconsiderate and shows a disregard for the author's needs.

Finally, in the last paragraph, the author scorns the recipient for mailing them a cheap, impersonal form letter. With the author already dealing with worries about their mortgage, hollyhocks, and blood pressure, the request to sit down and acknowledge the form letter seems insensitive and thoughtless.

Overall, these paragraphs highlight the frustration caused by the lack of consideration for personal desires and insensitivity in communication. The author's disappointment is evident in their emotional responses, expressing their need for more understanding and thoughtful communication.
