## The Importance of Nourishing Self-Esteem and Appreciation

Alfred Lunt, a renowned actor, once mentioned how he tried fasting for six days and nights as a fad. Surprisingly, it wasn't a challenging task, and he felt less hungry by the sixth day, compared to the second. However, it's strange that while we won't allow our loved ones or workers to go hungry for even a day, we sometimes neglect to appreciate them for weeks, months, or even years. 

This attitude can leave them wanting hearty, positive feedback, almost as much as they crave food. Alfred Lunt, during his leading role in Reunion in Vienna, commented on his need for self-esteem nourishment, saying, "There is nothing I need so much as nourishment for my self-esteem." While we may provide food to those in our care, we often forget to offer kind words of appreciation that can create everlasting memories. These words can be like the music of the morning stars, singing in their hearts for years to come. 

In one of his radio broadcasts, "The Rest of the Story," Paul Harvey also pointed out this crucial aspect of human interaction. It's important to nourish not only our physical bodies but also the self-esteem and emotional well-being of others. This simple act of appreciation can have a profound impact on individuals and relationships. 

We live in a world where the pace of life can often make us forget to acknowledge and appreciate the people around us. We get so caught up in the hustle and bustle that we neglect to recognize and value the efforts, contributions, and presence of others. We take people for granted, assuming that they know how much we appreciate them. However, this assumption can be detrimental to relationships, causing feelings of neglect and diminish self-esteem.

We often fail to realize that a few kind words can go a long way in nourishing someone's self-esteem. Just as food provides sustenance and energy to our bodies, appreciation acts as fuel for the soul. It uplifts spirits, boosts confidence, and creates a sense of validation and belonging.

Think about it - when was the last time someone genuinely expressed their appreciation for something you did? How did it make you feel? Chances are, even a small act of acknowledgment brought a smile to your face and made you feel valued. The same goes for others. When we take the time to appreciate and acknowledge the efforts of those around us, we not only make them feel seen and heard, but we also strengthen the bonds of our relationships.

Appreciation is not just a one-time gesture; it should be an ongoing practice. It's essential to show our gratitude consistently, giving sincere compliments and recognition regularly. By doing so, we create an environment where people feel valued and motivated to continue their efforts. 

Sometimes, we may hesitate to express our appreciation, thinking that it might seem corny or insincere. But just as genuine hunger cannot be satisfied with imaginary food, true self-esteem and emotional nourishment cannot be achieved with empty words. 

Therefore, the key lies in being authentic in our expressions of appreciation. Take the time to genuinely observe and recognize the qualities and actions of those around you. Instead of generic compliments, provide specific and meaningful feedback that acknowledges their unique contributions. A heartfelt "thank you" or a thoughtful note can go much further than a generic pat on the back.

In a world that often prioritizes productivity and tangible achievements, it's easy to overlook the power of appreciation. However, cultivating a culture of appreciation can transform relationships, boost morale, and create a positive atmosphere. When we nourish the self-esteem of others through our words and actions, we contribute to their overall well-being and happiness.

So, let's make a conscious effort to prioritize appreciation and nourishment of self-esteem in our interactions with others. Remember, just as food is essential for our physical health, acknowledgment and appreciation are vital for the emotional and psychological well-being of those around us. Together, let's create a world where everyone feels appreciated, valued, and truly seen for who they are and what they bring to our lives.
