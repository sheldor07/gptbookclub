## Key Idea: Advantages and Disadvantages of Renting the Ballroom for Lectures

Advantages:

"Ballroom-free." By renting out the ballroom for lectures and conventions, you will have the advantage of not having to pay for its use. This means that any revenue generated from events held in the ballroom will be profit for you. Dances and conventions, in particular, have the potential to generate significantly higher income compared to a series of lectures.

Disadvantages:

Firstly, renting out the ballroom for lectures might actually decrease your income rather than increasing it. The rent you are asking for may be unaffordable for the speaker, resulting in them choosing an alternative venue for their lectures.

Another disadvantage to consider is that these lectures attract educated and cultured individuals to your hotel. This serves as excellent advertising for your establishment. In fact, the number of people attracted to your hotel through these lectures far surpasses what a five-thousand-dollar newspaper advertisement would bring in. The visibility and reputation gained from hosting such lectures are valuable assets for your business.
