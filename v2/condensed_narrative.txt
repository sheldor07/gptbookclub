4. What are the four dreams that would change it all? Using the 6-month timeline, star or otherwise highlight the four most exciting and/or important dreams from all columns. Repeat the process with the 12-month timeline if desired.

5. Determine the cost of these dreams and calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for both timelines. If financeable, what is the cost per month for each of the four dreams (rent, mortgage, payment plan installments, etc.)? Start thinking of income and expense in terms of monthly cash flow – dollars in and dollars out – instead of grand totals. Things often cost much, much less than expected. For example, a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder fresh off the showroom floor at $260,000 can be had for $2,897.80 per month. I found my personal favourite, an Aston Martin DB 9 with 1,000 miles on it, through eBay for $136,000 – $2,003.10 per month. How about a Round-the-World trip (Los...

Chapter 52 Insights:
Key Ideas:
'The key concept that the author presents in this text is the idea of eliminating distractions and time wasters in order to focus on what is truly important. The author identifies three primary culprits of distractions: time wasters, time consumers, and time demanders.', '', '1. Time wasters refer to activities that can be ignored without consequence, such as unimportant meetings, discussions, web surfing, and emails. The author suggests limiting access to these distractions and funneling communication toward immediate action.', '', '2. Time consumers are monotonous tasks or requests that require attention and frequently interfere with high-level work. Examples include reading and responding to emails, making phone calls, and customer service tasks. The author suggests batching similar tasks together and setting dedicated times to check and respond to emails.', '', '3. Time demanders are emergent tasks that genuinely require immediate attention, such as critical client issues or policy changes. The author suggests managing personal errands, repetitive actions, and tasks through delegation or empowering others to make decisions independently.', '', 'The author provides specific strategies for each type of distraction. For time wasters, the author suggests implementing autoresponses for emails, setting aside specific times for phone calls, and using virtual assistants to screen calls and emails. For time consumers, the author suggests setting specific times to check and respond to emails, using filters to prioritize important emails, and unsubscribing from unnecessary newsletters. For time demanders, the author suggests mastering the art of refusal and avoiding unnecessary meetings, setting clear objectives and end times for meetings, and empowering others to make decisions independently.', '', 'The author also emphasizes the importance of establishing boundaries and avoiding interruptions. Strategies for this include using headphones or pretending to be on the phone to signal focus, setting clear boundaries with phone calls, and mastering the art of refusal with unnecessary requests.', '', 'Furthermore, the author introduces the concept of empowerment failure, which refers to being unable to accomplish a task without obtaining permission or information. The author suggests empowering employees or contractors with access to necessary information and decision-making abilities to reduce micromanagement and increase productivity.', '', 'Finally, the author provides various tools and tricks to help eliminate distractions and increase productivity, such as using apps like Evernote for capturing and organizing information, using services like GrandCentral and YouMail to screen and manage phone calls, and using tools like Doodle and TimeDriver to simplify scheduling.', '', 'Overall, the key ideas presented in this text revolve around the importance of eliminating distractions, prioritizing tasks, setting boundaries, and empowering others to increase productivity and focus on what is truly important.'

The answer came to him quickly, "None of them." He explained that he had spent more than 30 years with people he didn't like to buy things he didn't need. Life had become a succession of trophy wives (he was on lucky number three), expensive cars, and other empty bragging rights. Mark was one of the living dead.

Apples and Oranges: A Comparison

So, what makes the difference? What separates the New Rich, characterized by options, from the Deferrers (D), those who save it all for the end only to find that life has passed them by? It begins at the beginning. The New Rich can be separated from the crowd based on their goals, which reflect very distinct priorities and life philosophies.

Delving deeper into Cautions and Comparisons, we uncover more: Note how subtle differences in wording completely change the necessary actions for fulfilling what, at a glance, appear to be similar goals. These are not limited to business owners. Even the first, as I will show later, applies to employees.

Desiring to:

D: Work for yourself.

NR: Have others work for you.

D: Work when you want to.

NR: Prevent work for work’s sake and to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect ("minimum effective load").

D: Retire early or young.

NR: Distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life on a regular basis and recognize that inactivity is not the goal. Doing what excites you is.

D: Buy all the things you want to have.

NR: Do all the things you want to do and be all the things you want to be. if this includes some tools and gadgets, so be it, but they are either means to an end or bonuses, not the focus.

D: Be the boss instead of the employee; to be in charge.

NR: Be neither the boss nor the employee, but the owner. To own the trains and have.

Delving deeper into Cautions and Comparisons, we uncover more: Someone else, ensure they run on time.

D: To make a ton of money.

NR: To make a ton of money with specific reasons and defined dreams to chase, timelines, and steps included.

What are you working for?

D: To have more.

NR: To have more quality and less clutter, to have huge financial reserves, but recognize that most material wants are justifications for spending time on the things that don't really matter, including buying things and preparing to buy things.

You spent two weeks negotiating your new Infiniti with the dealership and got $10,000 off? That's great. Does your life have a purpose? Are you contributing anything useful to this world, or just shuffling papers, banging on a keyboard, and coming home to a drunken existence on the weekends?

Delving deeper into Cautions and Comparisons, we uncover more: a life most would envy. But it took me a while to realize that I was on the wrong train, hurtling at lightning speed toward a destination I didn't r eally want. I had to jump off the wrong train and search for my own, the one that would make me truly happy. 

The ultimate goal is not money or prestige, but happiness. Most people spend their lives chasing after success or following a predetermined path, never taking a moment to consider whether it's what they truly want. They sacrifice their happiness for the sake of following someone else’s idea of success, whether that’s climbing the corporate ladder or keeping up with the Joneses. 

To truly be happy, you need to find and pursue your passions. This may require taking risks, but it’s worth it in the end. Don't be afraid to dig deep and find what makes you truly happy, even if it seems unconventional or difficult. Remember, the ultimate goal is happiness, not a big payday. 

So take a moment to step back and reassess your life. Are you on the right train? If not, it's never too late to jump off and find your own path. Don't fool yourself into thinking that success or money will bring you happiness. Pursue what you love and success will follow.

Like a king, lounging by the infinity pool of a private villa. Here’s the little secret I rarely tell: it all cost less than rent in the U.S. If you can free your time and location, your money is automatically worth 3-10 times as much. This has nothing to do with currency rates. Being financially rich and having the ability to live like a millionaire are fundamentally two very different things. Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W's you control in your life: what you do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it. I call this the “freedom multiplier.” Using this as our criterion, the 80-hour-per-week, $500,000-per-year investment banker is less “powerful” than the employed NR who works ¼ the hours for $40,000 but has complete freedom of when, where, and how to live. The former’s $500,000 may be worth less than $40,000 and the latter’s $40,000 worth more than $500,000 when we run the numbers and look at the lifestyle output of their money. Options—the ability to choose—are real power. This book is all about how to see and create.

 The employee who rearranges his schedule and negotiates a remote work agreement to achieve 90% of the results in one-tenth of the time, which frees him to practice cross-country skiing and take road trips with his family two weeks per month. 

 The business owner who eliminates the least profitable customers and projects, outsources all operations entirely, and travels the world collecting rare documents, all while working remotely on a website to showcase her own illustration work. 

 The student who elects to risk it all—which is nothing—to establish an online video rental service that delivers $5,000 per month in income from a small niche of Blu-ray aficionados, a two-hour-per-week side project that allows him to work full-time as an animal rights lobbyist. 

The options are limitless, but each path begins with the same first step: replacing assumptions. To join the movement, you will need to learn a new lexicon and recalibrate direction using a compass for an unusual world. From inverting responsibility to jettisoning the entire concept of “success,” we need to change the rules.

Dale Begg-Smith executed the backflip perfectly - skis crossed in an X over his head - and landed in the record books as he slid across the finish. It was February 16, 2006, and he was now a mogul-skiing gold medalist at the Turin Winter Olympics. 

Unlike other full-time athletes, he will never have to return to a dead-end job after his moment of glory, nor will he look back at this day as the climax of his only passion. After all, he was only 21 years old and drove a black Lamborghini. 

Born a Canadian and something of a late bloomer, Dale found his calling - an Internet-based IT company - at the age of 13. Fortunately, he had a more experienced

Delving deeper into Cautions and Comparisons, we uncover more: Dale had a mentor and partner to guide him, his 15-year-old brother, Jason. They created a company to fund their dreams of standing atop the Olympic podium. It became the third-largest company of its kind in the world only two years later. While Dale's teammates were hitting the slopes for extra sessions, he was often buying sake for clients in Tokyo. In a world of "work harder, not smarter," Dale's coaches felt he was spending too much time on his business and not enough time on training, despite his results. Rather than choosing between his business or his dream, Dale chose to move laterally with both, from either/or to both/and. He wasn't spending too much time on his business; he and his brother were spending too much time with Canucks. 

In 2002, they moved to the ski capital of the world, Australia, where the team was smaller, more flexible, and coached by a legend. Three short years later, Dale received citizenship, went head-to-head against former teammates, and became the third "Aussie" in history to win winter gold. In the land of wallabies and big surf, Dale has since gone postal. Literally.

NEW CALEDONIA, SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN

"Once you say you're going to settle for second, that's what happens to you in life." —JOHN F. KENNEDY

Some people remain convinced that just a bit more money will make things right. Their goals are arbitrary moving targets: $300,000 in the bank, $1,000,000 in the portfolio, $100,000 a year instead of $50,000, etc. Julie's goal made intrinsic sense: come back with the same number of children she had left with.

Delving deeper into Cautions and Comparisons, we uncover more: tasks, until one day Julie and Marc realized that if they didn't pursue their dream now, they might never do it. So, they saved every penny, learned to sail, and set off on an adventure of a lifetime.

She reclined in her seat and glanced across the aisle past her sleeping husband, Marc, counting as she had done thousands of times - one, two, three. So far so good. In 12 hours, they would all be back in Paris, safe and sound. That was assuming the plane from New Caledonia held together, of course. 

New Caledonia, nestled in the tropics of the Coral Sea, was a French territory and where Julie and Marc had just sold the sailboat that took them 15,000 miles around the world. Of course, recouping their initial investment had been part of the plan. All said and done, their 15-month exploration of the globe, from the gondola-rich waterways of Venice to the tribal shores of Polynesia, had cost between $18,000 and $19,000 - less than rent and baguettes in Paris. 

Most people would consider this impossible. Then again, most people don’t know that more than 300 families set sail from France each year to do the same. The trip had been a dream for almost two decades, relegated to the back of the line behind an ever-growing list of responsibilities. Each passing moment brought a new list of tasks until one day, Julie and Marc realized that if they didn't pursue their dream now, they might never do it. So, they saved every penny, learned to sail, and set off on an adventure of a lifetime.

Delving deeper into Cautions and Comparisons, we uncover more: Reasons for Putting it Off

One day, Julie realized that if she didn't do it now, she would never do it. The rationalizations, legitimate or not, would just continue to add up and make it harder to convince herself that escape was possible. One year of preparation and one 30-day trial run with her husband later, they set sail on the trip of a lifetime. Julie realized almost as soon as the anchor lifted that far from being a reason not to travel and seek adventure, children are perhaps the best reason of all to do both.

Pre-trip, her three little boys had fought like banshees at the drop of a hat. In the process of learning to coexist in a floating bedroom, they learned patience, as much for themselves as for the sanity of their parents. Pre-trip, books were about as appealing as eating sand. Given the alternative of staring at a wall on the open sea, all three learned to love books. Pulling them out of school for one academic year and exposing them to new environments had proven to be the best investment in their education to date.

Delving deeper into Cautions and Comparisons, we uncover more: Now, sitting in the plane, Julie looked out at the clouds as the wing cut past them, already thinking of their next plans: to find a place in the mountains and ski all year long, using income from a sail-rigging workshop to fund the slopes and more travel. Now that she had done it once, she had the itch. 

LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION 

I was done with driving across town to collect my son from childcare, only to slide across icy highways trying to get back to work with him in tow to finish my work. My mini-retirement brought us both to live at an alternative boarding school, full of creative lifestyle redesigning children and staff in a gorgeous Florida forest with a spring-fed pond and plenty of sunshine.

Beating the Game, Not Playing the Game
In 1999, sometime after quitting my second unfulfilling job and eating peanut butter sandwiches for comfort, I won the gold medal at the Chinese Kickboxing (Sanshou) National Championships.

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: matches, but lost a lot of friends.

It wasn't because I was good at punching and kicking. God forbid! That seemed a bit dangerous, considering I did it on a dare and had four weeks of preparation. Besides, I have a watermelon head—it's a big target. I won by reading the rules and looking for unexploited opportunities, of which there were two:

1. Weigh-ins were the day prior to competition: Using dehydration techniques commonly practiced by elite powerlifters and Olympic wrestlers, I lost 28 pounds in 18 hours, weighed in at 165 pounds, and then hyperhydrated back to 193 pounds.

2. It's hard to fight someone from three weight classes above you. Poor little guys.

There was a technicality in the fine print: If one combatant fell off the elevated platform three times in a single round, his opponent won by default. I decided to use this technicality as my principal technique and push people off. As you might imagine, this did not make the judges the happiest Chinese I've ever seen. The result? I won all of my matches but lost a lot of friends.

But, isn't pushing people out of the ring pushing the boundaries of ethics? Not at all - it's no more than doing the uncommon within the rules. The important distinction is that between official rules and self-imposed rules. Consider the following example from the official website of the Olympic Movement (www.olympic.org). The 1968 Mexico City Olympics marked the international debut of Dick Fosbury and his celebrated "Fosbury Flop," which would soon revolutionize high-jumping. At the time, jumpers swung their outside foot up and over the bar [called the "straddle," much like a hurdle jump, it allowed you to land on your feet]. Fosbury's technique began by racing up to the bar at great speed and taking off from his right (or outside) foot. Then he twisted his body so that he went over the bar head-first with his back to the bar. While the coaches of the world shook their heads in disbelief, the Mexico City audience was absolutely captivated by Fosbury and shouted, "Olé!" as he cleared the bar.

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: Fosbury cleared every height through 2.22 metres without a miss and then achieved a personal record of 2.24 metres to win the gold medal. By 1980, 13 of the 16 Olympic finalists were using the Fosbury Flop. 

The weight-cutting techniques and off-platform throwing I used are now standard features of Sanshou competition. I didn’t cause it. I just foresaw it as inevitable, as did others who tested this superior approach. Now it’s par for the course. 

Sports evolve when sacred cows are killed, when basic assumptions are tested. The same is true in life and lifestyles.

Most people walk down the street on their legs. Does that mean I walk down the street on my hands? Do I wear my underwear outside of my pants in the name of being different? Not usually, no. Then again, walking on my legs and keeping my thong on the inside have worked just fine thus far. I don't fix it if it isn't broken.

Different is better when it is more effective or more fun. If everyone is defining a problem or solving it one way and the results are subpar, this is the time to ask, "What if I did the opposite?" Don't follow a model that doesn't work. If the recipe sucks, it doesn't matter how good a cook you are.

When I was in data storage sales, my first gig out of college, I realized that most cold calls didn't get to the intended person for one reason: gatekeepers. If I simply made all my calls from 8:00-8:30 A.M. and 6:00-6:30 P.M., for a total of one hour, I was able to avoid secretaries and book more than twice as many meetings.

The basic rules of successful Nra are surprisingly uniform and predictably divergent from what the rest of the world is doing. The following rules are the fundamental differentiators to keep in mind throughout this book:

1. Retirement is worst-case-scenario insurance. Retirement planning is like life insurance. It should be viewed as nothing more than a hedge against the absolute worst-case scenario: in this case, becoming physically incapable of working and needing a reservoir of capital to survive. Retirement as a goal or final redemption is flawed for at least three solid reasons: 

a. It is predicated on the assumption that you dislike what you are doing during the most physically capable years of your life. This is a nonstarter; nothing can justify that sacrifice.

b. Most people will never be able to retire and maintain even a hotdog standard of living.

c. Extraordinary goals and dreams outside of money require an extraordinary effort and sacrifice, but are not impossible.

2. There is an inverse relationship between time and money. The goal is to reduce required inputs (time) while maximizing output (money).

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: Hotdogs for dinner standard of living. Even one million is chump change in a world where traditional retirement could span 30 years and inflation lowers your purchasing power 2-4% per year. The math doesn't work. The golden years become lower-middle-class life revisited. That's a bittersweet ending. 

If the math does work, it means that you are one ambitious, hardworking machine. If that’s the case, guess what? One week into retirement, you’ll be so damn bored that you’ll want to stick bicycle spokes in your eyes. You’ll probably opt to look for a new job or start another company. Kinda defeats the purpose of waiting, doesn't it?

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: I'm not saying don't plan for the worst-case scenario. I have maxed out my 401(k)s and IRAs primarily for tax purposes, but don't mistake retirement for the ultimate goal. 

Interest and energy are cyclical. If I offered you $10,000,000 to work 24 hours a day for 15 years and then retire, would you do it? Of course not! It's unsustainable, just like the idea of a career that requires doing the same thing for 8+ hours per day until you break down or have enough cash to stop permanently. How else can my 30-year-old friends look like a cross between Donald Trump and Joan Rivers? It's terrible—premature aging fueled by triple bypass frappuccinos and impossible workloads. Alternating periods of activity and rest are necessary to survive, let alone thrive. Capacity, interest, and mental endurance all wax and wane. Plan accordingly. The aim is to distribute "mini-retirements" throughout life instead of hoarding the recovery and enjoyment for the fool's gold of retirement. By working only when necessary, we can enjoy more of life's opportunities.

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: You are most effective. Life is both more productive and enjoyable. It’s the perfect example of having your cake and eating it too. Personally, I now aim for one month of overseas relocation or high-intensity learning (tango, fighting, whatever) for every two months of work projects.

Less is not laziness. Doing less meaningless work, so you can focus on things of greater personal importance is not laziness. This is hard for most people to accept because our culture tends to reward personal sacrifice instead of personal productivity. Few people choose to measure the results of their actions and measure their contribution in time. More time equals more self-worth and more reinforcement from those above and around them. The NR, despite fewer hours in the office, produce more meaningful results than the next dozen non-NR combined. Let’s define “laziness” anew—to endure a non-ideal existence, to let circumstance or others decide life for you, or to amass a fortune while passing through life like a spectator from an office window. The size of your bank account doesn’t change this, nor does the number of hours you log in.

The timing is never right. I once asked my mom how she decided when to have her first child, little ol’ me. The answer was simple: "It was something we wanted, and we decided there was no point in putting it off. The timing is never right to have a baby." And so it is. For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never align, and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn't go out of its way to line up all the pins either.

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: organizing and planning, but I am terrible at public speaking. Rather than spend years of frustration trying to improve my public speaking skills, it makes more sense to focus on what I am naturally good at and find ways to use those strengths to achieve my goals. This doesn’t mean completely ignoring areas of weakness, but it does mean recognizing that trying to fix everything may not be the best use of our time and energy. By emphasizing our strengths, we can make the most out of our natural talents and abilities.

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: Product creation and marketing, but terrible at most of the things that follow. My body is designed to lift heavy objects and throw them, and that's it. I ignored this for a long time. I tried swimming and looked like a drowning monkey. I tried basketball and looked like a caveman. Then I became a fighter and took off. It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in your armor. The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair.

7. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite. It is possible to have too much of a good thing. In excess, most endeavors and possessions take on the characteristics of their opposite. Thus, pacifists become militants, freedom fighters become tyrants, blessings become curses, help becomes hindrance, and more becomes less. Too much, too many, and too often of...

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: What you want can become what you don't want. This is true for possessions and even time. Lifestyle design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle time, which can be poisonous, but in the positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed to what you feel obligated to do. 

Money alone is not the solution. There is much to be said for the power of money as currency (I'm a fan myself), but adding more of it just isn't the answer as often as we'd like to think. In part, it's laziness. "If only I had more money" is the easiest way to postpone the intense self-

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: nutrient is a nutrient, regardless of the source? Or do different foods affect our metabolism in unique ways? Similarly, economists study the value of money and the role it plays in our lives. Is all money equal, regardless of how we earn it or how much we have? Or is it relative income, the income we have in comparison to others, that truly affects our well-being? Research suggests that it’s the latter. While absolute income does play a role in our happiness, it is relative income that has a stronger impact. People who earn more than their peers experience higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction, regardless of their actual income level. In other words, if everyone you know makes $50,000 a year and you make $60,000, you will likely be happier than if you make $70,000 and everyone else makes $80,000. Understanding this can help us make better decisions about our careers and financial goals. Ultimately, it’s about achieving the right balance between work, money, and enjoyment in life.

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: Is a rose a rose? Is fat loss as simple as expending more calories than you consume, or is the source of those calories important? Based on work with top athletes, I know the answer to be the latter. What about income? Is a dollar a dollar a dollar? The New Rich don’t think so. Let’s look at this like a fifth-grade math problem.

Two hardworking chaps are headed toward each other. Chap A is moving at 80 hours per week and Chap B is moving at 10 hours per week. They both make $50,000 per year. Who will be richer when they pass in the middle of the night? If you said B, you would be correct, and this is the difference between absolute and relative income. 

Absolute income is measured using one holy and inalterable variable: the raw and almighty dollar. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year and is thus twice as rich as John Doe, who makes $50,000 per year. Relative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usually hours. The whole “per year” concept is arbitrary and makes it easy to trick yourself. Let’s look at the real trade. Jane Doe makes...

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: $100,000 per year, $2,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, and works 80 hours per week. Jane Doe thus makes $25 per hour. John Doe makes $50,000 per year, $1,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, but works 10 hours per week and hence makes $100 per hour. In relative income, John is four times richer. Of course, relative income has to add up to the minimum amount necessary to actualize your goals.

If I make $100 per hour but only work one hour per week, it’s going to be hard for me to run amuck like a superstar. Assuming that the total absolute income is where it needs to be to live my dreams (not an arbitrary point of comparison with the Joneses), relative income is the real measurement of wealth for the New Rich. The top New Rich mavericks make at least $5,000 per hour. Out of college, I started at about $5. I’ll get you closer to the former.

10. Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good.

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: following text has been cleaned:

Unbeknownst to most fun-loving bipeds, not all stress is bad. Indeed, the New Rich don’t aim to eliminate all stress. Not in the least. There are two separate types of stress, each as different as euphoria and its seldom-mentioned opposite, dysphoria.

Distress refers to harmful stimuli that make you weaker, less confident, and less able. Destructive criticism, abusive bosses, and smashing your face on a curb are examples of this. These are things we want to avoid.

Eustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for “healthy,” is used in the same sense in the word “euphoria.” Role models who push us to exceed our limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of eustress—stress that is healthy and the stimulus for growth.

People who avoid all criticism fail. It’s destructive criticism we need to avoid, not criticism in all forms. Similarly, there is no progress without eustress, and the more eustress we can create or apply to our lives, the sooner we can actualize our dreams.

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: Trick is telling the two apart. The New Rich are equally aggressive in removing distress and finding eustress.

Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
1. How has being "realistic" or "responsible" kept you from the life you want?
2. How has doing what you "should" resulted in subpar experiences or regret for not having done something else?
3. Look at what you're currently doing and ask yourself, "What would happen if I did the opposite of the people around me? What will I sacrifice if I continue on this track for 5, 10, or 20 years?"

2. Most people will assume this type of weight manipulation is impossible, so I've provided sample photographs at www.fourhourblog.com. Do NOT try this at home. I did it all under medical supervision.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Twenty feet and closing. "Run! Ruuuuuuuuuun!" Hans didn't speak Portuguese, but the meaning was clear enough—haul ass. His sneakers gripped firmly on the jagged rock, and he drove his chest forward toward 3,000 feet of nothing. He held his breath on the final step, and the panic drove him to near unconsciousness. His vision blurred at the edges, closing to a single pinpoint of light, and then…he floated. The all-consuming celestial blue of the horizon hit his visual field an instant after he realized that the thermal updraft had caught him and the wings of the paraglider. Fear was behind him on the mountaintop, and thousands of feet above the resplendent green rainforest and pristine white beaches of Copacabana, Hans Keeling had seen the light.

That was Sunday. On Monday, Hans returned to his law office in Century City, Los Angeles's posh corporate haven, and promptly handed in his three-week notice.

Delving deeper into Rules That Change the Rules, we uncover more: Nearly five years, he had faced his alarm clock with the same dread: "I have to do this for another 40-45 years?" He had once slept under his desk at the office after a punishing half-done project, only to wake up and continue on it the next morning. That same morning, he had made himself a promise: two more times and I'm out of here. Strike number three came the day before he left for his Brazilian vacation. We all make these promises to ourselves, and Hans had done it before as well, but things were somehow different now. He was different. He had realized something while arcing in slow circles toward the Earth - risks weren't that scary once you took them.

His colleagues told him what he expected to hear: he was throwing it all away. He was an attorney on his way to the top - what the hell did he want? Hans didn't know exactly what he wanted, but he had tasted it. On the other hand, he did know what bored him to tears, and he was done with it. No more passing days as the living dead, no more dinners where his colleagues compared cars.
