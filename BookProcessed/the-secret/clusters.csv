However, by focusing on your positive characteristics, you'll attract positivity and change your mindset. Remember, you attract what you think about, so always think positively about yourself."", 'Chapter 7 reveals the secret to having successful relationships. Dr. John Hagelin, a quantum physicist, believes that the body is a reflection of our thoughts. Medical science is starting to appreciate the power of thoughts and emotions to determine our physical makeup. In the same vein, Dr. John Demartini speaks of the placebo effect in medicine. Taking a pill is sometimes no different than just telling a patient that it works. As such, our mindset is critical in our interactions with others.', 'Chapter 7 of ""The Secret"" is all about the secrets to relationships. The chapter lays emphasis on the fact that our thoughts shape our actions and surroundings. Our innermost thoughts are often reflected in our actions and surroundings, as seen in the story of the film producer who had painted many women turning away from him. The chapter also highlights the need to give more to oneself, to fill oneself up fully and then overflow in giving.

Finally, the chapter concludes that looking out for oneself is really looking out for others and is the only way to benefit permanently.', ""Chapter 7 teaches us that it's important to love ourselves first before we can expect others to love us. Our outside world reflects our inner world, and if we don't believe in our beauty, it will be hard for others to see it. This chapter reinforces the importance of visualizing and affirming what we want in a partner or relationship. One man's positive visualization of dating three women a week manifested that wish, and he later used the same technique to find a happy marriage. We must align our thoughts and feelings with what we truly desire to attract the right kind of relationships into our lives."", ""Chapter 7 of The Secret is all about relationships. James Ray emphasizes understanding yourself before expecting others to enjoy your company. The law of attraction requires a clear perspective and positive energy to attract positivity into your life. Bob Proctor and Marc Ishimoff encourage a healthy respect for yourself to love others automatically. In relationships, focus on yourself and ensure your actions don't contradict your desires. Mike Dooley's audio course tells the story of a woman who wanted to attract her perfect partner by aligning her actions with her desires. The Secret teaches the power of positive energy in relationships.""]"
