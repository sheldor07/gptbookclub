Ten seconds passed.\u201cPatti,\u201d I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me tenseconds to remember my own mother\u2019s name.That is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handlethe rapid swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before theambulance arrived. Minutes later, I was carried out of school and takento the local hospital.Shortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggledwith basic functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my firstseizure of the day. Then I stopped breathing entirely. As the doctorshurried to supply me with oxygen, they also decided the local hospitalwas unequipped to handle the situation and ordered a helicopter to flyme to a larger hospital in Cincinnati.I was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward thehelipad across the street. The stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk asone nurse pushed me along while another pumped each breath into meby hand. My mother, who had arrived at the hospital a few momentsbefore, climbed into the helicopter beside me. I remained unconsciousand unable to breathe on my own as she held my hand during theflight.While my mother rode with me in the helicopter, my", "father wenthome to check on my brother and sister and break the news to them.He choked back tears as he explained to my sister that he would missher eighth-grade graduation ceremony that night. After passing mysiblings off to family and friends, he drove to Cincinnati to meet mymother.When my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team ofnearly twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad andwheeled me into the trauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my brainhad become so severe that I was having repeated post-traumaticseizures. My broken bones needed to be fixed, but I was in nocondition to undergo surgery. After yet another seizure\u2014my third ofthe day\u2014I was put into a medically induced coma and placed on aventilator.My parents were no strangers to this hospital. Ten years earlier,they had entered the same building on the ground floor after my sister", "was diagnosed with leukemia at age three. I was five at the time. Mybrother was just six months old. After two and a half years ofchemotherapy treatments, spinal taps, and bone marrow biopsies, mylittle sister finally walked out of the hospital happy, healthy, andcancer free. And now, after ten years of normal life, my parents foundthemselves back in the same place with a different child.While I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a socialworker to comfort my parents. It was the same priest who had metwith them a decade earlier on the evening they found out my sister hadcancer.As day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. Myparents slept restlessly on a hospital mattress\u2014one moment theywould collapse from fatigue, the next they would be wide awake withworry. My mother would tell me later, \u201cIt was one of the worst nightsI\u2019ve ever had.\u201dMY RECOVERYMercifully, by the next morning my breathing had rebounded to thepoint where the doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the coma.When I finally regained consciousness, I discovered that I had lost myability to smell. As a test, a nurse asked me to blow my nose and sniffan apple juice box. My", "sense of smell returned, but\u2014to everyone\u2019ssurprise\u2014the act of blowing my nose forced air through the fracturesin my eye socket and pushed my left eye outward. My eyeball bulgedout of the socket, held precariously in place by my eyelid and the opticnerve attaching my eye to my brain.The ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide back intoplace as the air seeped out, but it was hard to tell how long this wouldtake. I was scheduled for surgery one week later, which would allow mesome additional time to heal. I looked like I had been on the wrong endof a boxing match, but I was cleared to leave the hospital. I returnedhome with a broken nose, half a dozen facial fractures, and a bulgingleft eye.The following months were hard. It felt like everything in my lifewas on pause. I had double vision for weeks; I literally couldn\u2019t seestraight. It took more than a month, but my eyeball did eventuallyreturn to its normal location. Between the seizures and my vision", "problems, it was eight months before I could drive a car again. Atphysical therapy, I practiced basic motor patterns like walking in astraight line. I was determined not to let my injury get me down, butthere were more than a few moments when I felt depressed andoverwhelmed.I became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I returned tothe baseball field one year later. Baseball had always been a major partof my life. My dad had played minor league baseball for the St. LouisCardinals, and I had a dream of playing professionally, too. Aftermonths of rehabilitation, what I wanted more than anything was to getback on the field.But my return to baseball was not smooth. When the season rolledaround, I was the only junior to be cut from the varsity baseball team. Iwas sent down to play with the sophomores on junior varsity. I hadbeen playing since age four, and for someone who had spent so muchtime and effort on the sport, getting cut was humiliating. I vividlyremember the day it happened. I sat in my car and cried as I flippedthrough the radio, desperately searching for a song that would makeme feel better.After a year of self-doubt,", "I managed to make the varsity team as asenior, but I rarely made it on the field. In total, I played eleveninnings of high school varsity baseball, barely more than a single game.Despite my lackluster high school career, I still believed I couldbecome a great player. And I knew that if things were going toimprove, I was the one responsible for making it happen. The turningpoint came two years after my injury, when I began college at DenisonUniversity. It was a new beginning, and it was the place where I woulddiscover the surprising power of small habits for the first time.HOW I LEARNED ABOUT HABITSAttending Denison was one of the best decisions of my life. I earned aspot on the baseball team and, although I was at the bottom of theroster as a freshman, I was thrilled. Despite the chaos of my highschool years, I had managed to become a college athlete.I wasn\u2019t going to be starting on the baseball team anytime soon, so Ifocused on getting my life in order. While my peers stayed up late and", "played video games, I built good sleep habits and went to bed earlyeach night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point tokeep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, butthey gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confidentagain. And this growing belief in myself rippled into the classroom as Iimproved my study habits and managed to earn straight A\u2019s during myfirst year.A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly\u2014and, inmany cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulatedsmall but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that wereunimaginable to me when I started. For example, for the first time inmy life, I made it a habit to lift weights multiple times per week, and inthe years that followed, my six-foot-four-inch frame bulked up from afeatherweight 170 to a lean 200 pounds.When my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting role on thepitching staff. By my junior year, I was voted team captain and at theend of the season, I was selected for the all-conference team. But it wasnot until my senior season that my sleep habits, study habits, andstrength-training habits really began to pay", "off.Six years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, flown tothe hospital, and placed into a coma, I was selected as the top maleathlete at Denison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-America Team\u2014an honor given to just thirty-three players across thecountry. By the time I graduated, I was listed in the school recordbooks in eight different categories. That same year, I was awarded theuniversity\u2019s highest academic honor, the President\u2019s Medal.I hope you\u2019ll forgive me if this sounds boastful. To be honest, therewas nothing legendary or historic about my athletic career. I neverended up playing professionally. However, looking back on thoseyears, I believe I accomplished something just as rare: I fulfilled mypotential. And I believe the concepts in this book can help you fulfillyour potential as well.We all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and theexperience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small andunimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you\u2019rewilling to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in thelong run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our", "habits. With the same habits, you\u2019ll end up with the same results. Butwith better habits, anything is possible.Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible successovernight. I don\u2019t know any of them, and I\u2019m certainly not one of them.There wasn\u2019t one defining moment on my journey from medicallyinduced coma to Academic All-American; there were many. It was agradual evolution, a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs.The only way I made progress\u2014the only choice I had\u2014was to startsmall. And I employed this same strategy a few years later when Istarted my own business and began working on this book.HOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOKIn November 2012, I began publishing articles at jamesclear.com. Foryears, I had been keeping notes about my personal experiments withhabits and I was finally ready to share some of them publicly. I beganby publishing a new article every Monday and Thursday. Within a fewmonths, this simple writing habit led to my first one thousand emailsubscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number had grown to morethan thirty thousand people.In 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousandsubscribers, which made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters onthe internet. I had felt like an", "impostor when I began writing two yearsearlier, but now I was becoming known as an expert on habits\u2014a newlabel that excited me but also felt uncomfortable. I had neverconsidered myself a master of the topic, but rather someone who wasexperimenting alongside my readers.In 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email subscribers andsigned a book deal with Penguin Random House to begin writing thebook you are reading now. As my audience grew, so did my businessopportunities. I was increasingly asked to speak at top companiesabout the science of habit formation, behavior change, and continuousimprovement. I found myself delivering keynote speeches atconferences in the United States and Europe.In 2016, my articles began to appear regularly in major publicationslike Time, Entrepreneur, and Forbes. Incredibly, my writing was readby over eight million people that year. Coaches in the NFL, NBA, andMLB began reading my work and sharing it with their teams.", "At the start of 2017, I launched the Habits Academy, which becamethe premier training platform for organizations and individualsinterested in building better habits in life and work.* Fortune 500companies and growing start-ups began to enroll their leaders andtrain their staff. In total, over ten thousand leaders, managers,coaches, and teachers have graduated from the Habits Academy, andmy work with them has taught me an incredible amount about what ittakes to make habits work in the real world.As I put the finishing touches on this book in 2018, jamesclear.comis receiving millions of visitors per month and nearly five hundredthousand people subscribe to my weekly email newsletter\u2014a numberthat is so far beyond my expectations when I began that I\u2019m not evensure what to think of it.HOW THIS BOOK WILL BENEFIT YOUThe entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, \u201cTo write agreat book, you must first become the book.\u201d I originally learned aboutthe ideas mentioned here because I had to live them. I had to rely onsmall habits to rebound from my injury, to get stronger in the gym, toperform at a high level on the field, to become a writer, to build asuccessful business, and simply to develop into a responsible adult.Small habits", "helped me fulfill my potential, and since you picked upthis book, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019d like to fulfill yours as well.In the pages that follow, I will share a step-by-step plan for buildingbetter habits\u2014not for days or weeks, but for a lifetime. While sciencesupports everything I\u2019ve written, this book is not an academic researchpaper; it\u2019s an operating manual. You\u2019ll find wisdom and practicaladvice front and center as I explain the science of how to create andchange your habits in a way that is easy to understand and apply.The fields I draw on\u2014biology, neuroscience, philosophy,psychology, and more\u2014have been around for many years. What I offeryou is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long timeago as well as the most compelling discoveries scientists have maderecently. My contribution, I hope, is to find the ideas that matter mostand connect them in a way that is highly actionable.

Readers with a psychology backgroundmay recognize some of these terms from operant conditioning, whichwas first proposed as \u201cstimulus, response, reward\u201d by B. F. Skinner inthe 1930s and has been popularized more recently as \u201ccue, routine,reward\u201d in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.Behavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered theright reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certainway. But while Skinner\u2019s model did an excellent job of explaining howexternal stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation forhow our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internalstates\u2014our moods and emotions\u2014matter, too. In recent decades,scientists have begun to determine the connection between ourthoughts, feelings, and behavior. This research will also be covered inthese pages.In total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of thecognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first modelsof human behavior to accurately account for both the influence ofexternal stimuli and internal emotions on our habits.

Theorganization, which was the governing body for professionalcycling in Great Britain, had recently hired Dave Brailsford as its newperformance director. At the time, professional cyclists in Great Britainhad endured nearly one hundred years of mediocrity. Since 1908,British riders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic Games,and they had fared even worse in cycling\u2019s biggest race, the Tour deFrance. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event.In fact, the performance of British riders had been sounderwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europerefused to sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it wouldhurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using their gear.Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory.What made him different from previous coaches was his relentlesscommitment to a strategy that he referred to as \u201cthe aggregation ofmarginal gains,\u201d which was the philosophy of searching for a tinymargin of improvement in everything you do. Brailsford said, \u201cThewhole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everythingyou could think of that goes into riding a bike, and", "then improve it by 1percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them alltogether.\u201dBrailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments youmight expect from a professional cycling team. They redesigned thebike seats to make them more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on thetires for a better grip. They asked riders to wear electrically heatedovershorts to maintain ideal muscle temperature while riding and used"]}, "chapter 2": {"name": "The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits", "text": ["biofeedback sensors to monitor how each athlete responded to aparticular workout. The team tested various fabrics in a wind tunneland had their outdoor riders switch to indoor racing suits, whichproved to be lighter and more aerodynamic.But they didn\u2019t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find1 percent improvements in overlooked and unexpected areas. Theytested different types of massage gels to see which one led to the fastestmuscle recovery. They hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best wayto wash their hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold. Theydetermined the type of pillow and mattress that led to the best night\u2019ssleep for each rider. They even painted the inside of the team truckwhite, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would normallyslip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the finelytuned bikes.As these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated,the results came faster than anyone could have imagined.Just five years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling teamdominated the road and track cycling events at the 2008 OlympicGames in Beijing, where they won an astounding 60 percent of thegold medals available. Four years later, when the Olympic Games cameto London, the Brits raised the", "bar as they set nine Olympic recordsand seven world records.That same year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist towin the Tour de France. The next year, his teammate Chris Froomewon the race, and he would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017,giving the British team five Tour de France victories in six years.During the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won178 world championships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic goldmedals and captured five Tour de France victories in what is widelyregarded as the most successful run in cycling history.*How does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinaryathletes transform into world champions with tiny changes that, atfirst glance, would seem to make a modest difference at best? Why dosmall improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, andhow can you replicate this approach in your own life?WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE", "It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining momentand underestimate the value of making small improvements on a dailybasis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requiresmassive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business,writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal,we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shatteringimprovement that everyone will talk about.Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn\u2019t particularly notable\u2014sometimes it isn\u2019t even noticeable\u2014but it can be far more meaningful,especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can makeover time is astounding. Here\u2019s how the math works out: if you can get1 percent better each day for one year, you\u2019ll end up thirty-seven timesbetter by the time you\u2019re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worseeach day for one year, you\u2019ll decline nearly down to zero. What startsas a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something muchmore.1% BETTER EVERY DAY1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.031% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78", "FIGURE 1: The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, ifyou can get just 1 percent better each day, you\u2019ll end up with results that arenearly 37 times better after one year.Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The sameway that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects ofyour habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make littledifference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over themonths and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two,five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and thecost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We oftendismiss small changes because they don\u2019t seem to matter very much inthe moment. If you save a little money now, you\u2019re still not amillionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you\u2019re still out ofshape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven\u2019tlearned the language. We make a few changes, but the results neverseem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy tolet a", "bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scaledoesn\u2019t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family,", "they will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off untiltomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decisionis easy to dismiss.But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicatingpoor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing littleexcuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It\u2019s theaccumulation of many missteps\u2014a 1 percent decline here and there\u2014that eventually leads to a problem.The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effectof shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine youare flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving fromLAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land inWashington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barelynoticeable at takeoff\u2014the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet\u2014but when magnified across the entire United States, you end uphundreds of miles apart.*Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to avery different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span ofmoments that make up a lifetime these choices determine thedifference between", "who you are and who you could be. Success is theproduct of daily habits\u2014not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.That said, it doesn\u2019t matter how successful or unsuccessful you areright now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on thepath toward success. You should be far more concerned with yourcurrent trajectory than with your current results. If you\u2019re a millionairebut you spend more than you earn each month, then you\u2019re on a badtrajectory. If your spending habits don\u2019t change, it\u2019s not going to endwell. Conversely, if you\u2019re broke, but you save a little bit every month,then you\u2019re on the path toward financial freedom\u2014even if you\u2019removing slower than you\u2019d like.Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worthis a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a laggingmeasure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure ofyour learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaninghabits. You get what you repeat.", "If you want to predict where you\u2019ll end up in life, all you have to dois follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your dailychoices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are youspending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into thegym each week? Are you reading books and learning something neweach day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define yourfuture self.Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It willmultiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Badhabits make time your enemy.Habits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down justas easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understandingthe details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how todesign them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of theblade.YOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOUPositive CompoundingProductivity compounds. Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day,but it counts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task or masteringa new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can", "handle without thinking, the moreyour brain is free to focus on other areas.Knowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won\u2019t make you a genius, but acommitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read notonly teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about oldideas. As Warren Buffett says, \u201cThat\u2019s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compoundinterest.\u201dRelationships compound. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you helpothers, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can resultin a network of broad and strong connections over time.Negative CompoundingStress compounds. The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities.The worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves,these common causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, littlestresses compound into serious health issues.Negative thoughts compound. The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly,the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop.The same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing peopleas angry, unjust, or selfish, you see", "those kind of people everywhere.Outrage compounds. Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely the result of a singleevent. Instead, a long series of microaggressions and daily aggravations slowly multiply untilone event tips the scales and outrage spreads like wildfire.", "WHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKEImagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you.The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.Twenty-six degrees.Twenty-seven.Twenty-eight.The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.Twenty-nine degrees.Thirty.Thirty-one.Still, nothing has happened.Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift,seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, hasunlocked a huge change.Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previousactions, which build up the potential required to unleash a majorchange. This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percentof its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboocan barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive rootsystems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air withinsix weeks.Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you crossa critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the earlyand middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley ofDisappointment.

But in orderto make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough tobreak through this plateau\u2014what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a badone, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is oftenbecause you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential.Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is likecomplaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it fromtwenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is justbeing stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential,people will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees themost dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know thatit\u2019s the work you did long ago\u2014when it seemed that you weren\u2019tmaking any progress\u2014that makes the jump today possible.It is the human equivalent of geological pressure.

The San Antonio Spurs, one of the mostsuccessful teams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformerJacob Riis hanging in their locker room: \u201cWhen nothing seems to help,I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps ahundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at thehundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not thatlast blow that did it\u2014but all that had gone before.\u201dTHE PLATEAU OF LATENT POTENTIAL", "FIGURE 2: We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hopeit will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. It isnot until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previouswork we have done. This can result in a \u201cvalley of disappointment\u201d wherepeople feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard workwithout experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted. It wassimply being stored. It is not until much later that the full value of previousefforts is revealed.All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habitis a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habitsprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branchesgrow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oakwithin us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating adelicate flower one day at a time.But what determines whether we stick with a habit long enough tosurvive the Plateau of Latent Potential and break through to the otherside? What is it that causes some people to slide into unwanted habitsand enables others to enjoy the compounding effects of good", "ones?FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEADPrevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want inlife\u2014getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxingmore and worrying less, spending more time with friends and family\u2014is to set specific, actionable goals.", "For many years, this was how I approached my habits, too. Each onewas a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get inschool, for the weights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits Iwanted to earn in business. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot ofthem. Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to dowith the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems Ifollowed.What\u2019s the difference between systems and goals? It\u2019s a distinction Ifirst learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the Dilbertcomic. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems areabout the processes that lead to those results.If you\u2019re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Yoursystem is the way you recruit players, manage your assistantcoaches, and conduct practice.If you\u2019re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hireemployees, and run marketing campaigns.If you\u2019re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Yoursystem is how often you practice, how you break down and tackledifficult measures, and your method for", "receiving feedback fromyour instructor.Now for the interesting question: If you completely ignored yourgoals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? Forexample, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal towin a championship and focused only on what your team does atpractice each day, would you still get results?I think you would.The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would beridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The onlyway to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-timeSuper Bowl winner Bill Walsh, \u201cThe score takes care of itself.\u201d Thesame is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, thenforget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of coursenot. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for", "making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend toomuch time thinking about your goals and not enough time designingyour systems.Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. Weconcentrate on the people who end up winning\u2014the survivors\u2014andmistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success whileoverlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn\u2019tsucceed.Every Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wantsto get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share thesame goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winnersfrom the losers. It wasn\u2019t the goal of winning the Tour de France thatpropelled the British cyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably, theyhad wanted to win the race every year before\u2014just like every otherprofessional team. The goal had always been there. It was only whenthey implemented a system of continuous small improvements thatthey achieved a different outcome.Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If yousummon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room\u2014fornow. But if you maintain the same sloppy,", "pack-rat habits that led to amessy room in the first place, soon you\u2019ll be looking at a new pile ofclutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. You\u2019re left chasingthe same outcome because you never changed the system behind it.You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That\u2019s thecounterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need tochange our results, but the results are not the problem. What we reallyneed to change are the systems that cause those results. When yousolve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. Inorder to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systemslevel. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.", "Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: \u201cOnce I reach my goal,then I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d The problem with a goals-first mentality is thatyou\u2019re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. I\u2019veslipped into this trap so many times I\u2019ve lost count. For years,happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. Ipromised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or aftermy business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finallyrelax.Furthermore, goals create an \u201ceither-or\u201d conflict: either you achieveyour goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This ismisguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will matchthe exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no senseto restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many pathsto success.A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall inlove with the process rather than the product, you don\u2019t have to wait togive yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytimeyour system is running. And a system can be successful in manydifferent forms, not just the one you first", "envision.Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.Finally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a \u201cyo-yo\u201d effect. Manyrunners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line,they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. Whenall of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left topush you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people findthemselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose ofbuilding systems is to continue playing the game. True long-termthinking is goal-less thinking. It\u2019s not about any singleaccomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement andcontinuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to theprocess that will determine your progress.", "A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITSIf you\u2019re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn\u2019t you.The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again andagain not because you don\u2019t want to change, but because you have thewrong system for change.You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of yoursystems.Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one ofthe core themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meaningsbehind the word atomic. By now, you\u2019ve probably realized that anatomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percentimprovement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, howeversmall. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just asatoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are thebuilding blocks of remarkable results.Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamentalunit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tinyroutines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuelbigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost oftheir initial investment. They are both small and mighty.

Few things can have a more powerful impact on your lifethan improving your daily habits. And yet it is likely that this time nextyear you\u2019ll be doing the same thing rather than something better.It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a fewdays, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation.Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking arereasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle.However, once your habits are established, they seem to stickaround forever\u2014especially the unwanted ones. Despite our bestintentions, unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too muchtelevision, procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break.Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try tochange the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in thewrong way. In this chapter, I\u2019ll address the first point. In the chaptersthat follow, I\u2019ll answer the second.Our first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing. Tounderstand what I mean, consider that there are three levels at whichchange can occur. You can imagine them", "like the layers of an onion.THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE"]}, "chapter 3": {"name": "How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)", "text": ["FIGURE 3: There are three layers of behavior change: a change in youroutcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level isconcerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing abook, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set areassociated with this level of change.The second layer is changing your process. This level isconcerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing anew routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow,developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build areassociated with this level.The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. Thislevel is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, yourself-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of thebeliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do.Identity is about what you believe. When it comes to building habitsthat last\u2014when it comes to building a system of 1 percentimprovements\u2014the problem is not that one level is \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse\u201dthan another. All levels of change are useful in their own way. Theproblem is the direction of change.Many people begin the process of changing their habits", "by focusingon what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits.The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach,we start by focusing on who we wish to become.", "OUTCOME-BASED HABITS IDENTITY-BASED HABITS FIGURE 4: With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want toachieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish tobecome.Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, thefirst person says, \u201cNo thanks. I\u2019m trying to quit.\u201d It sounds like areasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smokerwho is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior willchange while carrying around the same beliefs.The second person declines by saying, \u201cNo thanks. I\u2019m not asmoker.\u201d It\u2019s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift inidentity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one.They no longer identify as someone who smokes.Most people don\u2019t even consider identity change when they set outto improve. They just think, \u201cI want to be skinny (outcome) and if Istick to this diet, then I\u2019ll be skinny (process).\u201d They set goals anddetermine the actions they should take to achieve those goals withoutconsidering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the", "way they look at themselves, and they don\u2019t realize that their oldidentity can sabotage their new plans for change.Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system ofa democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, andsocial equality. The system of a dictatorship has a very different set ofbeliefs like absolute authority and strict obedience. You can imaginemany ways to try to get more people to vote in a democracy, but suchbehavior change would never get off the ground in a dictatorship.That\u2019s not the identity of the system. Voting is a behavior that isimpossible under a certain set of beliefs.A similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals,organizations, or societies. There are a set of beliefs and assumptionsthat shape the system, an identity behind the habits.Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You maywant more money, but if your identity is someone who consumesrather than creates, then you\u2019ll continue to be pulled toward spendingrather than earning. You may want better health, but if you continue toprioritize comfort over accomplishment, you\u2019ll be drawn to relaxingrather than training. It\u2019s hard to change your habits if you neverchange the underlying beliefs that led to your past", "behavior. You havea new goal and a new plan, but you haven\u2019t changed who you are.The story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado,provides a good example. \u201cFor as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve chewedmy fingernails,\u201d Clark told me. \u201cIt started as a nervous habit when Iwas young, and then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual.One day, I resolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit.Through mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.\u201dThen, Clark did something surprising.\u201cI asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure,\u201d he said. \u201cMythought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn\u2019tchew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. Whathappened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for thefirst time. The manicurist even said that\u2014other than the chewing\u2014Ihad really healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was proud of myfingernails. And even though that\u2019s something I had never aspired to, itmade all the difference. I\u2019ve never chewed my nails since; not even a", "single close call. And it\u2019s because I now take pride in properly caringfor them.\u201dThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomespart of your identity. It\u2019s one thing to say I\u2019m the type of person whowants this. It\u2019s something very different to say I\u2019m the type of personwho is this.The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, themore motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. Ifyou\u2019re proud of how your hair looks, you\u2019ll develop all sorts of habits tocare for and maintain it. If you\u2019re proud of the size of your biceps,you\u2019ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you\u2019reproud of the scarves you knit, you\u2019ll be more likely to spend hoursknitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you\u2019ll fight toothand nail to maintain your habits.True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habitbecause of motivation, but the only reason you\u2019ll stick with one is thatit becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves tovisit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don\u2019t shift thebelief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-termchanges. Improvements are only temporary", "until they become part ofwho you are.The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become amusician.Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you dois an indication of the type of person you believe that you are\u2014eitherconsciously or nonconsciously.* Research has shown that once aperson believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are morelikely to act in alignment with that belief. For example, people whoidentified as \u201cbeing a voter\u201d were more likely to vote than those whosimply claimed \u201cvoting\u201d was an action they wanted to perform.Similarly, the person who incorporates exercise into their identitydoesn\u2019t have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing iseasy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned,", "you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting likethe type of person you already believe yourself to be.Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edgedsword. When working for you, identity change can be a powerful forcefor self-improvement. When working against you, though, identitychange can be a curse. Once you have adopted an identity, it can beeasy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change. Manypeople walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following thenorms attached to their identity.\u201cI\u2019m terrible with directions.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a morning person.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m bad at remembering people\u2019s names.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always late.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not good with technology.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m horrible at math.\u201d. . . and a thousand other variations.When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy toslide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, youbegin to resist certain actions because \u201cthat\u2019s not who I am.\u201d There isinternal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way thatis consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoidcontradicting yourself.The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, themore difficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable", "to believe whatyour culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity), even if it\u2019s wrong. The biggest barrier topositive change at any level\u2014individual, team, society\u2014is identityconflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict withyour identity, you will fail to put them into action.On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you\u2019retoo busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons.Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habitsis that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can\u2019t get tooattached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning.", "Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edityour beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.This brings us to an important question: If your beliefs andworldview play such an important role in your behavior, where do theycome from in the first place? How, exactly, is your identity formed?And how can you emphasize new aspects of your identity that serveyou and gradually erase the pieces that hinder you?THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITYYour identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with presetbeliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned andconditioned through experience.*More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity.When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of anorganized person. When you write each day, you embody the identityof a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identityof an athletic person.The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identityassociated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originallyderived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, andidentidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your\u201crepeated beingness.\u201dWhatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because youhave proof of it. If you", "go to church every Sunday for twenty years, youhave evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hourevery night, you have evidence that you are studious. If you go to thegym even when it\u2019s snowing, you have evidence that you are committedto fitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more stronglyyou will believe it.For most of my early life, I didn\u2019t consider myself a writer. If youwere to ask any of my high school teachers or college professors, theywould tell you I was an average writer at best: certainly not a standout.When I began my writing career, I published a new article everyMonday and Thursday for the first few years. As the evidence grew, sodid my identity as a writer. I didn\u2019t start out as a writer. I became onethrough my habits.", "Of course, your habits are not the only actions that influence youridentity, but by virtue of their frequency they are usually the mostimportant ones. Each experience in life modifies your self-image, butit\u2019s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because youkicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As yourepeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fadeaway while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which meansyour habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity.In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process ofbecoming yourself.This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping ourfingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit,day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoingmicroevolutions of the self.Each habit is like a suggestion: \u201cHey, maybe this is who I am.\u201d If youfinish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likesreading. If you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of personwho likes exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you arethe type of person who likes", "music.Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish tobecome. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votesbuild up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reasonwhy meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habitscan make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a newidentity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That\u2019s theparadox of making small improvements.Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path tochanging your identity. The most practical way to change who you areis to change what you do.Each time you write a page, you are a writer.Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.", "Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something farmore important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actuallyaccomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidencebegins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.Of course, it works the opposite way, too. Every time you choose toperform a bad habit, it\u2019s a vote for that identity. The good news is thatyou don\u2019t need to be perfect. In any election, there are going to be votesfor both sides. You don\u2019t need a unanimous vote to win an election;you just need a majority. It doesn\u2019t matter if you cast a few votes for abad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win themajority of the time.New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the samevotes you\u2019ve always cast, you\u2019re going to get the same results you\u2019vealways had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.It is a simple two-step process:1. Decide the type of person you want to be.2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.First, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level\u2014as anindividual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What", "do you wantto stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish tobecome?These are big questions, and many people aren\u2019t sure where to begin\u2014but they do know what kind of results they want: to get six-pack absor to feel less anxious or to double their salary. That\u2019s fine. Start thereand work backward from the results you want to the type of personwho could get those results. Ask yourself, \u201cWho is the type of personthat could get the outcome I want?\u201d Who is the type of person thatcould lose forty pounds? Who is the type of person that could learn anew language? Who is the type of person that could run a successfulstart-up?For example, \u201cWho is the type of person who could write a book?\u201dIt\u2019s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focusshifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of personwho is consistent and reliable (identity-based).This process can lead to beliefs like:", "\u201cI\u2019m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time andempathy they need.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the kind of manager who advocates for her employees.\u201dOnce you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, youcan begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have afriend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, \u201cWhat would ahealthy person do?\u201d All day long, she would use this question as aguide. Would a healthy person walk or take a cab? Would a healthyperson order a burrito or a salad? She figured if she acted like a healthyperson long enough, eventually she would become that person. Shewas right.The concept of identity-based habits is our first introduction toanother key theme in this book: feedback loops. Your habits shapeyour identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It\u2019s a two-waystreet. The formation of all habits is a feedback loop (a concept we willexplore in depth in the next chapter), but it\u2019s important to let yourvalues, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results.The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, notgetting a particular outcome.THE REAL REASON HABITS MATTERIdentity", "change is the North Star of habit change. The remainder ofthis book will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how tobuild better habits in yourself, your family, your team, your company,and anywhere else you wish. But the true question is: \u201cAre youbecoming the type of person you want to become?\u201d The first step is notwhat or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. Andthat\u2019s why we are starting here.You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Youridentity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. Youcan choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits youchoose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this bookand the real reason habits matter.", "Building better habits isn\u2019t about littering your day with life hacks.It\u2019s not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold showereach morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It\u2019s not aboutachieving external measures of success like earning more money,losing weight, or reducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all ofthese things, but fundamentally they are not about having something.They are about becoming someone.Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become thetype of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which youdevelop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you becomeyour habits.Chapter SummaryThere are three levels of change: outcome change, process change,and identity change.The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not onwhat you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote forthe type of person you wish to become.Becoming the best version of yourself requires you tocontinuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand youridentity.The real reason habits matter is not because they can get youbetter results (although they can do that), but because they canchange your beliefs about yourself.", "I 3How to Build Better Habits in 4 SimpleStepsN 1898, A psychologist named Edward Thorndike conducted anexperiment that would lay the foundation for our understanding ofhow habits form and the rules that guide our behavior. Thorndike wasinterested in studying the behavior of animals, and he started byworking with cats.He would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. Thebox was designed so that the cat could escape through a door \u201cby somesimple act, such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, orstepping on a platform.\u201d For example, one box contained a lever that,when pressed, would open a door on the side of the box. Once the doorhad been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food.Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside thebox. They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their pawsthrough openings, and claw at loose objects. After a few minutes ofexploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever, the doorwould open, and they would escape.Thorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. Inthe beginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But assoon as", "the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process oflearning began. Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action ofpressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and getting tothe food.After twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic andhabitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example,"]}, "chapter 4": {"name": "How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps", "text": ["Thorndike noted, \u201cCat 12 took the following times to perform the act.160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20,12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.\u201dDuring the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5minutes. During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3seconds. With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actionsbecame quicker and more automatic. Rather than repeat the samemistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process bystating, \u201cbehaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to berepeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are lesslikely to be repeated.\u201d His work provides the perfect starting point fordiscussing how habits form in our own lives. It also provides answersto some fundamental questions like: What are habits? And why doesthe brain bother building them at all?WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITSA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to becomeautomatic. The process of habit formation begins with trial and error.Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has tomake a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you", "comeacross a problem, you\u2019re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike\u2019s cat,you\u2019re just trying things out to see what works.Neurological activity in the brain is high during this period. You arecarefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions abouthow to act. You\u2019re taking in tons of new information and trying tomake sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effectivecourse of action.Occasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across asolution. You\u2019re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a runcalms you down. You\u2019re mentally exhausted from a long day of work,and you learn that playing video games relaxes you. You\u2019re exploring,exploring, exploring, and then\u2014BAM\u2014a reward.After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter yourstrategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the", "events that preceded the reward. Wait a minute\u2014that felt good. Whatdid I do right before that?This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn,try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away andthe useful actions get reinforced. That\u2019s a habit forming.Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins toautomate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series ofautomatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you faceregularly. As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, \u201cHabits are,simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.\u201dAs habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases.You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune outeverything else. When a similar situation arises in the future, you knowexactly what to look for. There is no longer a need to analyze everyangle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error andcreates a mental rule: if this, then that. These cognitive scripts can befollowed automatically whenever the situation is appropriate. Now,whenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run. As soon as you walkin the door from work, you grab the video game controller. A choicethat once required effort is", "now automatic. A habit has been created.Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, ahabit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve aproblem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can drawon this memory and automatically apply the same solution. Theprimary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict whatwill work in the future.Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind isthe bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem ata time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve yourconscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Wheneverpossible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to thenonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happenswhen a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free upmental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.Despite their efficiency, some people still wonder about the benefitsof habits. The argument goes like this: \u201cWill habits make my life dull? Idon\u2019t want to pigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don\u2019t enjoy. Doesn\u2019t", "so much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?\u201dHardly. Such questions set up a false dichotomy. They make you thinkthat you have to choose between building habits and attainingfreedom. In reality, the two complement each other.Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the peoplewho don\u2019t have their habits handled are often the ones with the leastamount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always bestruggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you willalways seem to be short on energy. Without good learning habits, youwill always feel like you\u2019re behind the curve. If you\u2019re always beingforced to make decisions about simple tasks\u2014when should I work out,where do I go to write, when do I pay the bills\u2014then you have less timefor freedom. It\u2019s only by making the fundamentals of life easier thatyou can create the mental space needed for free thinking andcreativity.Conversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics oflife are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challengesand master the next set of problems. Building habits in the presentallows you to do more of what you want in the future.THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORKThe", "process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps:cue, craving, response, and reward.* Breaking it down into thesefundamental parts can help us understand what a habit is, how itworks, and how to improve it. FIGURE 5: All habits proceed through four stages in the same order: cue,craving, response, and reward.This four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your brainruns through these steps in the same order each time.", "First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate abehavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Ourprehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled thelocation of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spendmost of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards likemoney and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love andfriendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course, thesepursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction,which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)Your mind is continuously analyzing your internal and externalenvironment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue isthe first indication that we\u2019re close to a reward, it naturally leads to acraving.Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational forcebehind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire\u2014without craving a change\u2014we have no reason to act. What you crave isnot the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not cravesmoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You arenot motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of aclean mouth. You do not want to turn on the", "television, you want to beentertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internalstate. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.Cravings differ from person to person. In theory, any piece ofinformation could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are notmotivated by the same cues. For a gambler, the sound of slot machinescan be a potent trigger that sparks an intense wave of desire. Forsomeone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino arejust background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted.The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are whattransform a cue into a craving.The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit youperform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether aresponse occurs depends on how motivated you are and how muchfriction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requiresmore physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then youwon\u2019t do it. Your response also depends on your ability. It soundssimple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. If you", "want to dunk a basketball but can\u2019t jump high enough to reach thehoop, well, you\u2019re out of luck.Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal ofevery habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is aboutwanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. Wechase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and(2) they teach us.The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewardsprovide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the energy youneed to survive. Getting a promotion brings more money and respect.Getting in shape improves your health and your dating prospects. Butthe more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eator to gain status or to win approval. At least for a moment, rewardsdeliver contentment and relief from craving.Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering inthe future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life,your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actionssatisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure anddisappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps yourbrain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards close thefeedback loop and complete the habit cycle.If a", "behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will notbecome a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start.Reduce the craving and you won\u2019t experience enough motivation toact. Make the behavior difficult and you won\u2019t be able to do it. And ifthe reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you\u2019ll have no reason to doit again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will notoccur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.THE HABIT LOOP", "FIGURE 6: The four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop.They form an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive. This\u201chabit loop\u201d is continually scanning the environment, predicting what willhappen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results.*In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response,which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately,becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form aneurological feedback loop\u2014cue, craving, response, reward; cue,craving, response, reward\u2014that ultimately allows you to createautomatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop.This four-step process is not something that happens occasionally,but rather it is an endless feedback loop that is running and activeduring every moment you are alive\u2014even now. The brain is continuallyscanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, tryingout different responses, and learning from the results. The entireprocess is completed in a split second, and we use it again and againwithout realizing everything that has been packed into the previousmoment.We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phaseand the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and thecraving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. Thesolution", "phase includes the response and the reward, and it is whenyou take action and achieve the change you desire.", "Problem phase1. Cue2. CravingSolution phase3. Response4. RewardAll behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimesthe problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtainit. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and youwant to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve theproblems you face.In the table on the following page, you can see a few examples ofwhat this looks like in real life.Imagine walking into a dark room and flipping on the light switch.You have performed this simple habit so many times that it occurswithout thinking. You proceed through all four stages in the fraction ofa second. The urge to act strikes you without thinking.Problem phase1. Cue: Your phone buzzes with a new text message.2. Craving: You want to learn the contents of the message.Solution phase3. Response: You grab your phone and read the text.4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to read the message. Grabbing your phone becomesassociated with your phone buzzing.Problem phase1. Cue: You are answering emails.2. Craving: You begin to feel stressed and overwhelmed by work. You want to feel in control.Solution phase3. Response: You bite your nails.4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to reduce", "stress. Biting your nails becomes associatedwith answering email.Problem phase1. Cue: You wake up.2. Craving: You want to feel alert.Solution phase", "3. Response: You drink a cup of coffee.4.

Checking social media becomesassociated with feeling stalled at work.Problem phase1. Cue: You walk into a dark room.2. Craving: You want to be able to see.Solution phase3. Response: You flip the light switch.4. Reward: You satisfy your craving to see. Turning on the light switch becomes associatedwith being in a dark room.By the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that arerunning our lives. Most of us never give a second thought to the factthat we tie the same shoe first each morning,", "or unplug the toasterafter each use, or always change into comfortable clothes after gettinghome from work. After decades of mental programming, weautomatically slip into these patterns of thinking and acting.THE FOUR LAWS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGEIn the following chapters, we will see time and again how the fourstages of cue, craving, response, and reward influence nearlyeverything we do each day. But before we do that, we need to", "transform these four steps into a practical framework that we can useto design good habits and eliminate bad ones.I refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior Change, andit provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breakingbad ones. You can think of each law as a lever that influences humanbehavior. When the levers are in the right positions, creating goodhabits is effortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearlyimpossible.How to Create a Good HabitThe 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.We can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad habit.How to Break a Bad HabitInversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.It would be irresponsible for me to claim that these four laws are anexhaustive framework for changing any human behavior, but I thinkthey\u2019re close. As you will soon see, the Four Laws of Behavior Changeapply to nearly every field, from sports to politics, art to", "medicine,comedy to management. These laws can be used no matter whatchallenge you are facing. There is no need for completely differentstrategies for each habit.Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply askyourself:1. How can I make it obvious?2. How can I make it attractive?3. How can I make it easy?4. How can I make it satisfying?", "If you have ever wondered, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I do what I say I\u2019m going todo? Why don\u2019t I lose the weight or stop smoking or save for retirementor start that side business? Why do I say something is important butnever seem to make time for it?\u201d The answers to those questions can befound somewhere in these four laws. The key to creating good habitsand breaking bad ones is to understand these fundamental laws andhow to alter them to your specifications. Every goal is doomed to fail ifit goes against the grain of human nature.Your habits are shaped by the systems in your life. In the chaptersthat follow, we will discuss these laws one by one and show how youcan use them to create a system in which good habits emerge naturallyand bad habits wither away.Chapter SummaryA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times tobecome automatic.The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life withas little energy and effort as possible.Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involvesfour steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules wecan use to build better habits.", "They are (1) make it obvious, (2)make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.", "4The Man Who Didn\u2019t Look RightTHE PSYCHOLOGIST GARY Klein once told me a story about a woman whoattended a family gathering. She had spent years working as aparamedic and, upon arriving at the event, took one look at her father-in-law and got very concerned.\u201cI don\u2019t like the way you look,\u201d she said.Her father-in-law, who was feeling perfectly fine, jokingly replied,\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like your looks, either.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted. \u201cYou need to go to the hospital now.\u201dA few hours later, the man was undergoing lifesaving surgery afteran examination had revealed that he had a blockage to a major arteryand was at immediate risk of a heart attack. Without his daughter-in-law\u2019s intuition, he could have died.What did the paramedic see? How did she predict his impendingheart attack?When major arteries are obstructed, the body focuses on sendingblood to critical organs and away from peripheral locations near thesurface of the skin. The result is a change in the pattern of distributionof blood in the face. After many years of working with people withheart failure, the woman had unknowingly developed the ability torecognize this pattern on sight. She couldn\u2019t explain what it was thatshe noticed in her father-in-law\u2019s face, but she knew something waswrong.Similar stories", "exist in other fields. For example, military analystscan identify which blip on a radar screen is an enemy missile and"]}, "chapter 5": {"name": "The Man Who Didn\"t Look Right", "text": ["which one is a plane from their own fleet even though they aretraveling at the same speed, flying at the same altitude, and lookidentical on radar in nearly every respect. During the Gulf War,Lieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved an entire battleship whenhe ordered a missile shot down\u2014despite the fact that it looked exactlylike the battleship\u2019s own planes on radar. He made the right call, buteven his superior officers couldn\u2019t explain how he did it.Museum curators have been known to discern the differencebetween an authentic piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeiteven though they can\u2019t tell you precisely which details tipped them off.Experienced radiologists can look at a brain scan and predict the areawhere a stroke will develop before any obvious signs are visible to theuntrained eye. I\u2019ve even heard of hairdressers noticing whether a clientis pregnant based only on the feel of her hair.The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously takingin your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across.Whenever you experience something repeatedly\u2014like a paramedicseeing the face of a heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing amissile on a radar screen\u2014your brain begins noticing what isimportant, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevantcues,", "and cataloging that information for future use.With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predictcertain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically,your brain encodes the lessons learned through experience. We can\u2019talways explain what it is we are learning, but learning is happening allalong the way, and your ability to notice the relevant cues in a givensituation is the foundation for every habit you have.We underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do withoutthinking. You do not tell your hair to grow, your heart to pump, yourlungs to breathe, or your stomach to digest. And yet your body handlesall this and more on autopilot. You are much more than your consciousself.Consider hunger. How do you know when you\u2019re hungry? You don\u2019tnecessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to realize that it is timeto eat. Appetite and hunger are governed nonconsciously. Your bodyhas a variety of feedback loops that gradually alert you when it is timeto eat again and that track what is going on around you and within you.Cravings can arise thanks to hormones and chemicals circulating", "through your body. Suddenly, you\u2019re hungry even though you\u2019re notquite sure what tipped you off.This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: youdon\u2019t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice anopportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention toit. This is what makes habits useful.It\u2019s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actionscome under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind.You fall into old patterns before you realize what\u2019s happening. Unlesssomeone points it out, you may not notice that you cover your mouthwith your hand whenever you laugh, that you apologize before asking aquestion, or that you have a habit of finishing other people\u2019s sentences.And the more you repeat these patterns, the less likely you become toquestion what you\u2019re doing and why you\u2019re doing it.I once heard of a retail clerk who was instructed to cut up empty giftcards after customers had used up the balance on the card. One day,the clerk cashed out a few customers in a row who purchased with giftcards. When the next person walked up, the clerk swiped thecustomer\u2019s actual credit card, picked up the scissors, and then cut it inhalf\u2014entirely", "on autopilot\u2014before looking up at the stunned customerand realizing what had just happened.Another woman I came across in my research was a formerpreschool teacher who had switched to a corporate job. Even thoughshe was now working with adults, her old habits would kick in and shekept asking coworkers if they had washed their hands after going to thebathroom. I also found the story of a man who had spent yearsworking as a lifeguard and would occasionally yell \u201cWalk!\u201d wheneverhe saw a child running.Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common thatthey are essentially invisible: the treats on the kitchen counter, theremote control next to the couch, the phone in our pocket. Ourresponses to these cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like theurge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin theprocess of behavior change with awareness.Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handleon our current ones. This can be more challenging than it soundsbecause once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly", "nonconscious and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can\u2019texpect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, \u201cUntil youmake the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you willcall it fate.\u201dTHE HABITS SCORECARDThe Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in theworld. If you ever find yourself riding a train in Tokyo, you\u2019ll noticethat the conductors have a peculiar habit.As each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual ofpointing at different objects and calling out commands. When the trainapproaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, \u201cSignal isgreen.\u201d As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator willpoint at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it\u2019s timeto leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Outon the platform, other employees are performing similar actions.Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge ofthe platform and declare, \u201cAll clear!\u201d Every detail is identified, pointedat, and named aloud.*This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety systemdesigned to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incrediblywell. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cutsaccidents by 30 percent.", "The MTA subway system in New York Cityadopted a modified version that is \u201cpoint-only,\u201d and \u201cwithin two yearsof implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57percent.\u201dPointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level ofawareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, andears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goeswrong.My wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing towalk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essentialitems in her packing list. \u201cI\u2019ve got my keys. I\u2019ve got my wallet. I\u2019ve gotmy glasses. I\u2019ve got my husband.\u201d", "The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are toconsciously think about it. And when we\u2019ve done something athousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume thatthe next time will be just like the last. We\u2019re so used to doing whatwe\u2019ve always done that we don\u2019t stop to question whether it\u2019s the rightthing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are largelyattributable to a lack of self-awareness.One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintainingawareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why theconsequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a \u201cpoint-and-call\u201d system for our personal lives. That\u2019s the origin of the HabitsScorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become moreaware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your dailyhabits.Here\u2019s a sample of where your list might start:Wake upTurn off alarmCheck my phoneGo to the bathroomWeigh myselfTake a showerBrush my teethFloss my teethPut on deodorantHang up towel to dryGet dressedMake a cup of tea. . . and so on.Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, \u201cIsthis a good habit, a bad habit, or", "a neutral habit?\u201d If it is a good habit,write \u201c+\u201d next to it. If it is a bad habit, write \u201c\u2013\u201d. If it is a neutral habit,write \u201c=\u201d.", "For example, the list above might look like this:Wake up =Turn off alarm =Check my phone \u2013Go to the bathroom =Weigh myself +Take a shower +Brush my teeth +Floss my teeth +Put on deodorant +Hang up towel to dry =Get dressed =Make a cup of tea +The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on yoursituation and your goals. For someone who is trying to lose weight,eating a bagel with peanut butter every morning might be a bad habit.For someone who is trying to bulk up and add muscle, the samebehavior might be a good habit. It all depends on what you\u2019re workingtoward.*Scoring your habits can be a bit more complex for another reason aswell. The labels \u201cgood habit\u201d and \u201cbad habit\u201d are slightly inaccurate.There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits.That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way\u2014even the bad ones\u2014which is why you repeat them. For this exercise,categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run.Generally speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Badhabits have net negative outcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reducestress right now (that\u2019s how it\u2019s serving you), but", "it\u2019s not a healthylong-term behavior.If you\u2019re still having trouble determining how to rate a particularhabit, here is a question I like to use: \u201cDoes this behavior help mebecome the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for", "or against my desired identity?\u201d Habits that reinforce your desiredidentity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desiredidentity are usually bad.As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to changeanything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on.Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment or internalcriticism. Don\u2019t blame yourself for your faults. Don\u2019t praise yourself foryour successes.If you eat a chocolate bar every morning, acknowledge it, almost asif you were watching someone else. Oh, how interesting that theywould do such a thing. If you binge-eat, simply notice that you areeating more calories than you should. If you waste time online, noticethat you are spending your life in a way that you do not want to.The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout forthem. If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in your own life. Say out loud the action that you arethinking of taking and what the outcome will be. If you want to cutback on your junk food habit but notice yourself grabbing anothercookie, say out loud, \u201cI\u2019m about to eat this cookie, but I don\u2019t need it.Eating it will", "cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.\u201dHearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequencesseem more real. It adds weight to the action rather than lettingyourself mindlessly slip into an old routine. This approach is usefuleven if you\u2019re simply trying to remember a task on your to-do list. Justsaying out loud, \u201cTomorrow, I need to go to the post office after lunch,\u201dincreases the odds that you\u2019ll actually do it. You\u2019re getting yourself toacknowledge the need for action\u2014and that can make all the difference.The process of behavior change always starts with awareness.Strategies like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard arefocused on getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge thecues that trigger them, which makes it possible to respond in a waythat benefits you.Chapter SummaryWith enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues thatpredict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.", "Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention towhat we are doing.The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. Youneed to be aware of your habits before you can change them.Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from anonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing youractions.The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to becomemore aware of your behavior.", "I 5The Best Way to Start a New HabitN 2001, RESEARCHERS in Great Britain began working with 248 peopleto build better exercise habits over the course of two weeks. Thesubjects were divided into three groups.The first group was the control group. They were simply asked totrack how often they exercised.The second group was the \u201cmotivation\u201d group. They were asked notonly to track their workouts but also to read some material on thebenefits of exercise. The researchers also explained to the group howexercise could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improveheart health.Finally, there was the third group. These subjects received the samepresentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equallevels of motivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a planfor when and where they would exercise over the following week.Specifically, each member of the third group completed the followingsentence: \u201cDuring the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutesof vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].\u201dIn the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercisedat least once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentationgiven to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact onbehavior.) But 91 percent of the third", "group exercised at least once perweek\u2014more than double the normal rate.The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as animplementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about"]}, "chapter 6": {"name": "The Best Way to Start a New Habit", "text": ["when and where to act.

Implementation intentions leverage both ofthese cues.Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementationintention is:\u201cWhen situation X arises, I will perform response Y.\u201dHundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions areeffective for sticking to our goals, whether it\u2019s writing down the exacttime and date of when you will get a flu shot or recording the time ofyour colonoscopy appointment. They increase the odds that people willstick with habits like recycling, studying, going to sleep early, andstopping smoking.Researchers have even found that voter turnout increases whenpeople are forced to create implementation intentions by answeringquestions like: \u201cWhat route are you taking to the polling station? Atwhat time are you planning to go? What bus will get you there?\u201d Othersuccessful government programs have prompted citizens to make aclear plan to send taxes in on time or provided directions on when andwhere to pay late traffic bills.The punch line is clear: people who", "make a specific plan for whenand where they will perform a new habit are more likely to followthrough. Too many people try to change their habits without thesebasic details figured out. We tell ourselves, \u201cI\u2019m going to eat healthier\u201dor \u201cI\u2019m going to write more,\u201d but we never say when and where thesehabits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and hope that wewill \u201cjust remember to do it\u201d or feel motivated at the right time. Animplementation intention sweeps away foggy notions like \u201cI want towork out more\u201d or \u201cI want to be more productive\u201d or \u201cI should vote\u201dand transforms them into a concrete plan of action.Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lackis clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Somepeople spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to makean improvement.", "Once an implementation intention has been set, you don\u2019t have towait for inspiration to strike. Do I write a chapter today or not? Do Imeditate this morning or at lunch? When the moment of actionoccurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow yourpredetermined plan.The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fillout this sentence:I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.Studying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in mybedroom.Exercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.Marriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in thekitchen.If you aren\u2019t sure when to start your habit, try the first day of theweek, month, or year. People are more likely to take action at thosetimes because hope is usually higher. If we have hope, we have areason to take action. A fresh start feels motivating.There is another benefit to implementation intentions. Beingspecific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you sayno to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull youoff course. We often say yes", "to little requests because we are not clearenough about what we need to be doing instead. When your dreamsare vague, it\u2019s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and neverget around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal isto make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition,you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can\u2019tsay why. As the writer Jason Zweig noted, \u201cObviously you\u2019re nevergoing to just work out without conscious thought. But like a dogsalivating at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the time of dayyou normally work out.\u201dThere are many ways to use implementation intentions in your lifeand work. My favorite approach is one I learned from Stanfordprofessor BJ Fogg and it is a strategy I refer to as habit stacking.", "HABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOURHABITSThe French philosopher Denis Diderot lived nearly his entire life inpoverty, but that all changed one day in 1765.Diderot\u2019s daughter was about to be married and he could not affordto pay for the wedding. Despite his lack of wealth, Diderot was wellknown for his role as the co-founder and writer of Encyclop\u00e9die, one ofthe most comprehensive encyclopedias of the time. When Catherinethe Great, the Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot\u2019s financial troubles,her heart went out to him. She was a book lover and greatly enjoyed hisencyclopedia. She offered to buy Diderot\u2019s personal library for \u00a31,000\u2014more than $150,000 today.* Suddenly, Diderot had money to spare.With his new wealth, he not only paid for the wedding but alsoacquired a scarlet robe for himself.Diderot\u2019s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that heimmediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded byhis more common possessions. He wrote that there was \u201cno morecoordination, no more unity, no more beauty\u201d between his elegant robeand the rest of his stuff.Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replacedhis rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his home withexpensive sculptures. He bought a mirror to place", "above the mantel,and a better kitchen table. He tossed aside his old straw chair for aleather one. Like falling dominoes, one purchase led to the next.Diderot\u2019s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for onepurchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. TheDiderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates aspiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.You can spot this pattern everywhere. You buy a dress and have toget new shoes and earrings to match. You buy a couch and suddenlyquestion the layout of your entire living room. You buy a toy for yourchild and soon find yourself purchasing all of the accessories that gowith it. It\u2019s a chain reaction of purchases.Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what todo next based on what you have just finished doing. Going to thebathroom leads to washing and drying your hands, which reminds youthat you need to put the dirty towels in the laundry, so you add laundry", "detergent to the shopping list, and so on. No behavior happens inisolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.Why is this important?When it comes to building new habits, you can use theconnectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways tobuild a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each dayand then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention.Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location,you pair it with a current habit. This method, which was created by BJFogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design anobvious cue for nearly any habit.*The habit stacking formula is:\u201cAfter [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].\u201dFor example:Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I willmeditate for one minute.Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediatelychange into my workout clothes.Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I\u2019mgrateful for that happened today.Marriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner akiss.Safety. After I put on my running shoes, I will", "text a friend orfamily member where I am running and how long it will take.The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you alreadydo each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you canbegin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. Thisallows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comesfrom one behavior leading into the next\u2014a positive version of theDiderot Effect.", "HABIT STACKING FIGURE 7: Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you\u2019ll stick with ahabit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one. This process canbe repeated to chain numerous habits together, each one acting as the cuefor the next.Your morning routine habit stack might look like this:1. After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixtyseconds.2. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list forthe day.3. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately beginmy first task.Or, consider this habit stack in the evening:", "1. After I finish eating dinner, I will put my plate directly into thedishwasher.2. After I put my dishes away, I will immediately wipe down thecounter.3. After I wipe down the counter, I will set out my coffee mug fortomorrow morning.You can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your currentroutines. For example, you may already have a morning routine thatlooks like this: Wake up > Make my bed > Take a shower. Let\u2019s say youwant to develop the habit of reading more each night. You can expandyour habit stack and try something like: Wake up > Make my bed >Place a book on my pillow > Take a shower. Now, when you climb intobed each night, a book will be sitting there waiting for you to enjoy.Overall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules thatguide your future behavior. It\u2019s like you always have a game plan forwhich action should come next. Once you get comfortable with thisapproach, you can develop general habit stacks to guide you wheneverthe situation is appropriate:Exercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead ofusing the elevator.Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will", "introduce myself tosomeone I don\u2019t know yet.Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will waittwenty-four hours before purchasing.Healthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will always putveggies on my plate first.Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away.(\u201cOne in, one out.\u201d)Mood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath andsmile before answering.Forgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the tableand chairs to make sure I don\u2019t leave anything behind.", "No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating asuccessful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.Unlike an implementation intention, which specifically states the timeand location for a given behavior, habit stacking implicitly has the timeand location built into it. When and where you choose to insert a habitinto your daily routine can make a big difference. If you\u2019re trying toadd meditation into your morning routine but mornings are chaoticand your kids keep running into the room, then that may be the wrongplace and time. Consider when you are most likely to be successful.Don\u2019t ask yourself to do a habit when you\u2019re likely to be occupied withsomething else.Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit.If you want to do a habit every day, but you stack it on top of a habitthat only happens on Mondays, that\u2019s not a good choice.One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is bybrainstorming a list of your current habits. You can use your HabitsScorecard from the last chapter as a starting point. Alternatively, youcan create a list with two columns. In the first column, write down thehabits you do each", "day without fail.*For example:Get out of bed.Take a shower.Brush your teeth.Get dressed.Brew a cup of coffee.Eat breakfast.Take the kids to school.Start the work day.Eat lunch.End the work day.Change out of work clothes.Sit down for dinner.", "Turn off the lights.Get into bed.Your list can be much longer, but you get the idea. In the secondcolumn, write down all of the things that happen to you each daywithout fail. For example:The sun rises.You get a text message.The song you are listening to ends.The sun sets.Armed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the bestplace to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific andimmediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. Imade this mistake myself. When I wanted to start a push-up habit, myhabit stack was \u201cWhen I take a break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.\u201dAt first glance, this sounded reasonable. But soon, I realized the triggerwas unclear. Would I do my push-ups before I ate lunch? After I atelunch? Where would I do them? After a few inconsistent days, Ichanged my habit stack to: \u201cWhen I close my laptop for lunch, I will doten push-ups next to my desk.\u201d Ambiguity gone.Habits like \u201cread more\u201d or \u201ceat better\u201d are worthy causes, but thesegoals do not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specificand clear: After I close the door. After I", "brush my teeth. After I sitdown at the table. The specificity is important. The more tightly boundyour new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you willnotice when the time comes to act.The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious. Strategieslike implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the mostpractical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clearplan for when and where to take action.Chapter SummaryThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious.", "The two most common cues are time and location.Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use topair a new habit with a specific time and location.The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at[TIME] in [LOCATION].Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with acurrent habit.The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will[NEW HABIT].", "AFTER 6Motivation Is Overrated; EnvironmentOften Matters MoreANNE THORNDIKE, A primary care physician at Massachusetts GeneralHospital in Boston, had a crazy idea. She believed she could improvethe eating habits of thousands of hospital staff and visitors withoutchanging their willpower or motivation in the slightest way. In fact, shedidn\u2019t plan on talking to them at all.Thorndike and her colleagues designed a six-month study to alterthe \u201cchoice architecture\u201d of the hospital cafeteria. They started bychanging how drinks were arranged in the room. Originally, therefrigerators located next to the cash registers in the cafeteria werefilled with only soda. The researchers added water as an option to eachone. Additionally, they placed baskets of bottled water next to the foodstations throughout the room. Soda was still in the primaryrefrigerators, but water was now available at all drink locations.Over the next three months, the number of soda sales at the hospitaldropped by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of bottled water increasedby 25.8 percent. They made similar adjustments\u2014and saw similarresults\u2014with the food in the cafeteria. Nobody had said a word toanyone eating there.BEFORE"]}, "chapter 7": {"name": "Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More", "text": ["FIGURE 8: Here is a representation of what the cafeteria looked like beforethe environment design changes were made (left) and after (right). Theshaded boxes indicate areas where bottled water was available in eachinstance. Because the amount of water in the environment was increased,behavior shifted naturally and without additional motivation.People often choose products not because of what they are, butbecause of where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate ofcookies on the counter, I\u2019ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even ifI hadn\u2019t been thinking about them beforehand and didn\u2019t necessarilyfeel hungry. If the communal table at the office is always filled withdoughnuts and bagels, it\u2019s going to be hard not to grab one every nowand then. Your habits change depending on the room you are in andthe cues in front of you.Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise againand again under certain environmental conditions. In church, peopletend to talk in whispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded.In this way, the most common form of change is not internal, butexternal: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit iscontext", "dependent.In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation thatmakes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person intheir Environment, or B = f (P,E).", "It didn\u2019t take long for Lewin\u2019s Equation to be tested in business. In1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he calledSuggestion Impulse Buying, which \u201cis triggered when a shopper sees aproduct for the first time and visualizes a need for it.\u201d In other words,customers will occasionally buy products not because they want thembut because of how they are presented to them.For example, items at eye level tend to be purchased more thanthose down near the floor. For this reason, you\u2019ll find expensive brandnames featured in easy-to-reach locations on store shelves becausethey drive the most profit, while cheaper alternatives are tucked awayin harder-to-reach spots. The same goes for end caps, which are theunits at the end of aisles. End caps are moneymaking machines forretailers because they are obvious locations that encounter a lot of foottraffic. For example, 45 percent of Coca-Cola sales come specificallyfrom end-of-the-aisle racks.The more obviously available a product or service is, the more likelyyou are to try it. People drink Bud Light because it is in every bar andvisit Starbucks because it is on every corner. We like to think that weare in control. If we choose water over soda, we assume it is becausewe wanted to", "do so. The truth, however, is that many of the actions wetake each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by themost obvious option.Every living being has its own methods for sensing andunderstanding the world. Eagles have remarkable long-distance vision.Snakes can smell by \u201ctasting the air\u201d with their highly sensitivetongues. Sharks can detect small amounts of electricity and vibrationsin the water caused by nearby fish. Even bacteria have chemoreceptors\u2014tiny sensory cells that allow them to detect toxic chemicals in theirenvironment.In humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous system.We perceive the world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste.But we also have other ways of sensing stimuli. Some are conscious,but many are nonconscious. For instance, you can \u201cnotice\u201d when thetemperature drops before a storm, or when the pain in your gut risesduring a stomachache, or when you fall off balance while walking onrocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide range ofinternal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your blood or the need todrink when thirsty.", "The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision.The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors.Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Someexperts estimate that half of the brain\u2019s resources are used on vision.Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, itshould come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst ofour behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can leadto a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can imagine howimportant it is to live and work in environments that are filled withproductive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.Thankfully, there is good news in this respect. You don\u2019t have to bethe victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.HOW TO DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESSDuring the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s, Dutchresearchers began to pay close attention to the country\u2019s energy usage.In one suburb near Amsterdam, they found that some homeownersused 30 percent less energy than their neighbors\u2014despite the homesbeing of similar size and getting electricity for the same price.It turned out the houses in this neighborhood were nearly identicalexcept for one feature:", "the location of the electrical meter. Some hadone in the basement. Others had the electrical meter upstairs in themain hallway. As you may guess, the homes with the meters located inthe main hallway used less electricity. When their energy use wasobvious and easy to track, people changed their behavior.Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to noticecues that stand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we liveand work often make it easy not to do certain actions because there isno obvious cue to trigger the behavior. It\u2019s easy not to practice theguitar when it\u2019s tucked away in the closet. It\u2019s easy not to read a bookwhen the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest room. It\u2019s easy not totake your vitamins when they are out of sight in the pantry. When thecues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.By comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw yourattention toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s, the cleaning staffat Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam installed a small sticker that lookedlike a fly near the center of each urinal. Apparently, when men stepped", "up to the urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug. Thestickers improved their aim and significantly reduced \u201cspillage\u201d aroundthe urinals. Further analysis determined that the stickers cut bathroomcleaning costs by 8 percent per year.I\u2019ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own life. I used tobuy apples from the store, put them in the crisper in the bottom of therefrigerator, and forget all about them. By the time I remembered, theapples would have gone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.Eventually, I took my own advice and redesigned my environment. Ibought a large display bowl and placed it in the middle of the kitchencounter. The next time I bought apples, that was where they went\u2014outin the open where I could see them. Almost like magic, I began eating afew apples each day simply because they were obvious rather than outof sight.Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and makethe cues for your preferred habits more obvious:If you want to remember to take your medication each night, putyour pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroomcounter.If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitarstand in the middle", "of the living room.If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep astack of stationery on your desk.If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles eachmorning and place them in common locations around the house.If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a bigpart of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually havemultiple cues. Consider how many different ways a smoker could beprompted to pull out a cigarette: driving in the car, seeing a friendsmoke, feeling stressed at work, and so on.The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinklingtriggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds thatyou\u2019ll think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the bestchoice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy andnatural when the cues for good habits are right in front of you.", "Environment design is powerful not only because it influences howwe engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most peoplelive in a world others have created for them. But you can alter thespaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positivecues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment designallows you to take back control and become the architect of your life.Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.THE CONTEXT IS THE CUEThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over timeyour habits become associated not with a single trigger but with theentire context surrounding the behavior.For example, many people drink more in social situations than theywould ever drink alone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather thewhole situation: watching your friends order drinks, hearing the musicat the bar, seeing the beers on tap.We mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur:the home, the office, the gym. Each location develops a connection tocertain habits and routines. You establish a particular relationship withthe objects on your desk, the items on your kitchen counter, the thingsin your bedroom.Our behavior is not defined", "by the objects in the environment but byour relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about theinfluence of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking aboutyour environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filledwith relationships. Think in terms of how you interact with the spacesaround you. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads foran hour each night. For someone else, the couch is where he watchestelevision and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Different people canhave different memories\u2014and thus different habits\u2014associated withthe same place.The good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit witha particular context.In one study, scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed onlywhen they were tired. If they couldn\u2019t fall asleep, they were told to sitin a different room until they became sleepy. Over time, subjects began", "to associate the context of their bed with the action of sleeping, and itbecame easier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed. Theirbrains learned that sleeping\u2014not browsing on their phones, notwatching television, not staring at the clock\u2014was the only action thathappened in that room.The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits canbe easier to change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtletriggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to anew place\u2014a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner ofyour room you seldom use\u2014and create a new routine there.It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to builda new habit in the face of competing cues. It can be difficult to go tobed early if you watch television in your bedroom each night. It can behard to study in the living room without getting distracted if that\u2019swhere you always play video games. But when you step outside yournormal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind. Youaren\u2019t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits toform without interruption.Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftoppatio, or a building with", "expansive architecture. Take a break from thespace where you do your daily work, which is also linked to yourcurrent thought patterns.Trying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at yourregular supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it easier toavoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn\u2019t automatically knowwhere it is located in the store.When you can\u2019t manage to get to an entirely new environment,redefine or rearrange your current one. Create a separate space forwork, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I finduseful is \u201cOne space, one use.\u201dWhen I started my career as an entrepreneur, I would often workfrom my couch or at the kitchen table. In the evenings, I found it verydifficult to stop working. There was no clear division between the endof work time and the beginning of personal time. Was the kitchen tablemy office or the space where I ate meals? Was the couch where Irelaxed or where I sent emails? Everything happened in the sameplace.", "A few years later, I could finally afford to move to a home with aseparate room for my office. Suddenly, work was something thathappened \u201cin here\u201d and personal life was something that happened\u201cout there.\u201d It was easier for me to turn off the professional side of mybrain when there was a clear dividing line between work life and homelife. Each room had one primary use. The kitchen was for cooking. Theoffice was for working.Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit withanother. When you start mixing contexts, you\u2019ll start mixing habits\u2014and the easier ones will usually win out. This is one reason why theversatility of modern technology is both a strength and a weakness.You can use your phone for all sorts of tasks, which makes it apowerful device. But when you can use your phone to do nearlyanything, it becomes hard to associate it with one task. You want to beproductive, but you\u2019re also conditioned to browse social media, checkemail, and play video games whenever you open your phone. It\u2019s amishmash of cues.You may be thinking, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I live in New YorkCity. My apartment is the size of a smartphone. I need each room toplay multiple roles.\u201d", "Fair enough. If your space is limited, divide yourroom into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a tablefor eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know awriter who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only forreading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habitshould have a home.If you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context willbecome associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habitsthrive under predictable circumstances like these. Focus comesautomatically when you are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation iseasier when you are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comesquickly when it is the only thing that happens in your bedroom. If youwant behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need anenvironment that is stable and predictable.A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose isan environment where habits can easily form.Chapter Summary", "Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behaviorover time.Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cuesthat stand out.Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single triggerbut with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The contextbecomes the cue.It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because youare not fighting against old cues.", "I 7The Secret to Self-ControlN 1971, as the Vietnam War was heading into its sixteenth year,congressmen Robert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphyfrom Illinois made a discovery that stunned the American public.While visiting the troops, they had learned that over 15 percent of U.S.soldiers stationed there were heroin addicts. Follow-up researchrevealed that 35 percent of service members in Vietnam had triedheroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted\u2014the problem waseven worse than they had initially thought.The discovery led to a flurry of activity in Washington, including thecreation of the Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention underPresident Nixon to promote prevention and rehabilitation and to trackaddicted service members when they returned home.Lee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a finding thatcompletely upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robinsfound that when soldiers who had been heroin users returned home,only 5 percent of them became re-addicted within a year, and just 12percent relapsed within three years. In other words, approximatelynine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in Vietnam eliminated theiraddiction nearly overnight.This finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, whichconsidered heroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversiblecondition. Instead, Robins revealed that addictions couldspontaneously dissolve if", "there was a radical change in theenvironment. In Vietnam, soldiers spent all day surrounded by cuestriggering heroin use: it was easy to access, they were engulfed by theconstant stress of war, they built friendships with fellow soldiers who"]}, "chapter 8": {"name": "The Secret to Self-Control", "text": ["were also heroin users, and they were thousands of miles from home.Once a soldier returned to the United States, though, he found himselfin an environment devoid of those triggers. When the context changed,so did the habit.Compare this situation to that of a typical drug user. Someonebecomes addicted at home or with friends, goes to a clinic to get clean\u2014which is devoid of all the environmental stimuli that prompt theirhabit\u2014then returns to their old neighborhood with all of their previouscues that caused them to get addicted in the first place. It\u2019s no wonderthat usually you see numbers that are the exact opposite of those in theVietnam study. Typically, 90 percent of heroin users become re-addicted once they return home from rehab.The Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefsabout bad habits because it challenged the conventional association ofunhealthy behavior as a moral weakness. If you\u2019re overweight, asmoker, or an addict, you\u2019ve been told your entire life that it is becauseyou lack self-control\u2014maybe even that you\u2019re a bad person. The ideathat a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeplyembedded in our culture.Recent research, however, shows something different. Whenscientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control,it", "turns out those individuals aren\u2019t all that different from those whoare struggling. Instead, \u201cdisciplined\u201d people are better at structuringtheir lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who needto use it the least. It\u2019s easier to practice self-restraint when you don\u2019thave to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower areessential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not bywishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a moredisciplined environment.This counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once youunderstand what happens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habitthat has been encoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever therelevant situation arises. When Patty Olwell, a therapist from Austin,Texas, started smoking, she would often light up while riding horseswith a friend. Eventually, she quit smoking and avoided it for years.She had also stopped riding. Decades later, she hopped on a horse", "again and found herself craving a cigarette for the first time in forever.The cues were still internalized; she just hadn\u2019t been exposed to themin a long time.Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever theenvironmental cues reappear. This is one reason behavior changetechniques can backfire. Shaming obese people with weight-losspresentations can make them feel stressed, and as a result manypeople return to their favorite coping strategy: overeating. Showingpictures of blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher levels ofanxiety, which drives many people to reach for a cigarette. If you\u2019re notcareful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to stop.Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster thefeelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Becauseyou eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feelsluggish, so you watch more television because you don\u2019t have theenergy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feelanxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makesyour health even worse and soon you\u2019re feeling more anxious. It\u2019s adownward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.Researchers refer to this phenomenon as \u201ccue-induced wanting\u201d: anexternal trigger causes", "a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit.Once you notice something, you begin to want it. This process ishappening all the time\u2014often without us realizing it.

This speed is too fast for the brain to consciously register\u2014theaddicts couldn\u2019t even tell you what they had seen\u2014but they craved thedrug all the same.Here\u2019s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you\u2019re unlikely toforget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into yourbrain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely\u2014even if they gounused for quite a while. And that means that simply resistingtemptation is an ineffective strategy. It is hard to maintain a Zenattitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy. Inthe short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put itbluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habitsin a negative environment.", "A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. Oneof the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduceexposure to the cue that causes it.If you can\u2019t seem to get any work done, leave your phone inanother room for a few hours.If you\u2019re continually feeling like you\u2019re not enough, stop followingsocial media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.If you\u2019re wasting too much time watching television, move the TVout of the bedroom.If you\u2019re spending too much money on electronics, quit readingreviews of the latest tech gear.If you\u2019re playing too many video games, unplug the console andput it in a closet after each use.This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change.Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible. I\u2019m oftensurprised by how effective simple changes like these can be. Remove asingle cue and the entire habit often fades away.Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.

Tinbergen\u2014who eventually won a Nobel Prize for hiswork\u2014was investigating herring gulls, the gray and white birds oftenseen flying along the seashores of North America.Adult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beak, andTinbergen noticed that newly hatched chicks would peck this spotwhenever they wanted food. To begin one experiment, he created acollection of fake cardboard beaks, just a head without a body. Whenthe parents had flown away, he went over to the nest and offered thesedummy beaks to the chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes, and heassumed the baby birds would reject them altogether.However, when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the cardboardbeak, they pecked away just as if it were attached to their own mother.They had a clear preference for those red spots\u2014as if they had beengenetically programmed at birth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that thebigger the red spot, the faster the chicks pecked. Eventually, he createda beak with three large red dots on it. When he placed it over the nest,the baby birds went crazy with delight. They pecked", "at the little redpatches as if it was the greatest beak they had ever seen.Tinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior in otheranimals. For example, the greylag goose is a ground-nesting bird.Occasionally, as the mother moves around on the nest, one of the eggswill roll out and settle on the grass nearby. Whenever this happens, thegoose will waddle over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull itback into the nest."]}, "chapter 9": {"name": "How to Make a Habit Irresistible", "text": ["Tinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby roundobject, such as a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. Thebigger the object, the greater their response. One goose even made atremendous effort to roll a volleyball back and sit on top. Like the babygulls automatically pecking at red dots, the greylag goose was followingan instinctive rule: When I see a round object nearby, I must roll itback into the nest. The bigger the round object, the harder I should tryto get it.It\u2019s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules forbehavior, and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule,it lights up like a Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggeratedcues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightenedversion of reality\u2014like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of avolleyball\u2014and it elicits a stronger response than usual.Humans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality.Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. Afterspending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging forfood in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value onsalt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are", "often calorie-dense and they werequite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah.When you don\u2019t know where your next meal is coming from, eating asmuch as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.Today, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food isabundant, but your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placinga high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to ourhealth, but the craving persists because the brain\u2019s reward centers havenot changed for approximately fifty thousand years. The modern foodindustry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond theirevolutionary purpose.A primary goal of food science is to create products that are moreattractive to consumers. Nearly every food in a bag, box, or jar hasbeen enhanced in some way, if only with additional flavoring.Companies spend millions of dollars to discover the most satisfyinglevel of crunch in a potato chip or the perfect amount of fizz in a soda.Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a product feels inyour mouth\u2014a quality known as orosensation. French fries, forexample, are a potent combination\u2014golden brown and crunchy on theoutside, light and smooth on the inside.", "Other processed foods enhance dynamic contrast, which refers toitems with a combination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy.Imagine the gooeyness of melted cheese on top of a crispy pizza crust,or the crunch of an Oreo cookie combined with its smooth center. Withnatural, unprocessed foods, you tend to experience the samesensations over and over\u2014how\u2019s that seventeenth bite of kale taste?After a few minutes, your brain loses interest and you begin to feel full.But foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience noveland interesting, encouraging you to eat more.Ultimately, such strategies enable food scientists to find the \u201cblisspoint\u201d for each product\u2014the precise combination of salt, sugar, and fatthat excites your brain and keeps you coming back for more. Theresult, of course, is that you overeat because hyperpalatable foods aremore attractive to the human brain. As Stephan Guyenet, aneuroscientist who specializes in eating behavior and obesity, says,\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.\u201dThe modern food industry, and the overeating habits it hasspawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change:Make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the morelikely it is to become habit-forming.Look around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions ofreality that are", "more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in.Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sellclothes. Social media delivers more \u201clikes\u201d and praise in a few minutesthan we could ever get in the office or at home. Online porn splicestogether stimulating scenes at a rate that would be impossible toreplicate in real life. Advertisements are created with a combination ofideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits\u2014even themodel doesn\u2019t look like the person in the final image. These are thesupernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate featuresthat are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result,driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, pornhabits, eating habits, and many others.If history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the future will bemore attractive than those of today. The trend is for rewards to becomemore concentrated and stimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is amore concentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard liquor is amore concentrated form of alcohol than beer. Video games are a more", "concentrated form of play than board games. Compared to nature,these pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have thebrains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face.If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then youneed to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law,our goal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is notpossible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we canmake any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start byunderstanding what a craving is and how it works.We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share\u2014the dopamine spike.THE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOPScientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuringa neurotransmitter called dopamine.* The importance of dopaminebecame apparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds andPeter Milner ran an experiment that revealed the neurologicalprocesses behind craving and desire. By implanting electrodes in thebrains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To thesurprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live. They wouldn\u2019t eat.They wouldn\u2019t have sex. They didn\u2019t crave anything. Within a few days,the animals died of thirst.In follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the", "dopamine-releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little dropletsof sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little ratfaces lit up with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Eventhough dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much asbefore; they just didn\u2019t want it anymore. The ability to experiencepleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And withoutdesire, action stopped.When other researchers reversed this process and flooded thereward system of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habitsat breakneck speed. In one study, mice received a powerful hit ofdopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes,the mice developed a craving so strong they began poking their noseinto the box eight hundred times per hour. (Humans are not so", "different: the average slot machine player will spin the wheel sixhundred times per hour.)Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that ishighly habit-forming\u2014taking drugs, eating junk food, playing videogames, browsing social media\u2014is associated with higher levels ofdopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviorslike eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, butnow we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes,including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion,and voluntary movement.When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine isreleased not only when you experience pleasure, but also when youanticipate it. Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right beforethey place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge ofdopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. Wheneveryou predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels ofdopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so doesyour motivation to act.It is the anticipation of a reward\u2014not the fulfillment of it\u2014that getsus to take action.Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain whenyou receive a reward is the same system that is activated when youanticipate a", "reward. This is one reason the anticipation of anexperience can often feel better than the attainment of it. As a child,thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening thegifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can bemore enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to thisas the difference between \u201cwanting\u201d and \u201cliking.\u201dTHE DOPAMINE SPIKE", "FIGURE 9: Before a habit is learned (A), dopamine is released when thereward is experienced for the first time. The next time around (B), dopaminerises before taking action, immediately after a cue is recognized. This spikeleads to a feeling of desire and a craving to take action whenever the cue isspotted. Once a habit is learned, dopamine will not rise when a reward isexperienced because you already expect the reward. However, if you see acue and expect a reward, but do not get one, then dopamine will drop indisappointment (C). The sensitivity of the dopamine response can clearly beseen when a reward is provided late (D). First, the cue is identified anddopamine rises as a craving builds. Next, a response is taken but the rewarddoes not come as quickly as expected and dopamine begins to drop. Finally,when the reward comes a little later than you had hoped, dopamine spikesagain. It is as if the brain is saying, \u201cSee! I knew I was right. Don\u2019t forget torepeat this action next time.\u201d", "Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wantingrewards than for liking them. The wanting centers in the brain arelarge: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmentalarea, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontalcortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are muchsmaller. They are often referred to as \u201chedonic hot spots\u201d and aredistributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance,researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens isactivated during wanting. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structureis activated during liking.The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to theregions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence ofthe crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drivesbehavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation thatprecedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of BehaviorChange. We need to make our habits attractive because it is theexpectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in thefirst place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundlingcomes into play.HOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR HABITSMORE ATTRACTIVERonan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in", "Dublin, Ireland,enjoyed watching Netflix, but he also knew that he should exercisemore often than he did. Putting his engineering skills to use, Byrnehacked his stationary bike and connected it to his laptop andtelevision. Then he wrote a computer program that would allow Netflixto run only if he was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed down fortoo long, whatever show he was watching would pause until he startedpedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan, \u201celiminating obesityone Netflix binge at a time.\u201dHe was also employing temptation bundling to make his exercisehabit more attractive. Temptation bundling works by linking an actionyou want to do with an action you need to do. In Byrne\u2019s case, hebundled watching Netflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding hisstationary bike (the thing he needed to do).", "Businesses are masters at temptation bundling. For instance, whenthe American Broadcasting Company, more commonly known as ABC,launched its Thursday-night television lineup for the 2014\u20132015season, they promoted temptation bundling on a massive scale.Every Thursday, the company would air three shows created byscreenwriter Shonda Rhimes\u2014Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Scandal, and How toGet Away with Murder. They branded it as \u201cTGIT on ABC\u201d (TGITstands for Thank God It\u2019s Thursday). In addition to promoting theshows, ABC encouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, andenjoy the evening.Andrew Kubitz, head of scheduling for ABC, described the ideabehind the campaign: \u201cWe see Thursday night as a viewershipopportunity, with either couples or women by themselves who want tosit down and escape and have fun and drink their red wine and havesome popcorn.\u201d The brilliance of this strategy is that ABC wasassociating the thing they needed viewers to do (watch their shows)with activities their viewers already wanted to do (relax, drink wine,and eat popcorn).Over time, people began to connect watching ABC with feelingrelaxed and entertained. If you drink red wine and eat popcorn at 8p.m. every Thursday, then eventually \u201c8 p.m. on Thursday\u201d meansrelaxation and entertainment. The reward gets associated with the cue,and the habit of turning on the television", "becomes more attractive.You\u2019re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do oneof your favorite things at the same time.

Maybe you want to get a pedicure, but youneed to clean out your email inbox.

In fact, it was all hebelieved in: he completely rejected the idea of innate talent. Heclaimed that with deliberate practice and the development of goodhabits, a child could become a genius in any field. His mantra was \u201cAgenius is not born, but is educated and trained.\u201dLaszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to test it withhis own children\u2014and he was writing to Klara because he \u201cneeded awife willing to jump on board.\u201d Klara was a teacher and, although shemay not have been as adamant as Laszlo, she also believed that withproper instruction, anyone could advance their skills.Laszlo decided chess would be a suitable field for the experiment,and he laid out a plan to raise his children to become chess prodigies.The kids would be home-schooled, a rarity in Hungary at the time. Thehouse would be filled with chess books and pictures of famous chessplayers. The children would play against each other constantly andcompete in the best tournaments they could find. The family wouldkeep a", "meticulous file system of the tournament history of everycompetitor the children faced. Their lives would be dedicated to chess.Laszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few years, thePolgars were parents to three young girls: Susan, Sofia, and Judit.Susan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was four years old.Within six months, she was defeating adults."]}, "chapter 10": {"name": "The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits", "text": ["Sofia, the middle child, did even better.

At fifteen years andfour months old, she became the youngest grandmaster of all time\u2014younger than Bobby Fischer, the previous record holder. For twenty-seven years, she was the number-one-ranked female chess player inthe world.The childhood of the Polgar sisters was atypical, to say the least.And yet, if you ask them about it, they claim their lifestyle wasattractive, even enjoyable. In interviews, the sisters talk about theirchildhood as entertaining rather than grueling. They loved playingchess. They couldn\u2019t get enough of it.

We want to fit in, to bond with others, andto earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations areessential to our survival. For most of our evolutionary history, ourancestors lived in tribes. Becoming separated from the tribe\u2014or worse,being cast out\u2014was a death sentence. \u201cThe lone wolf dies, but the packsurvives.\u201d*Meanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyedincreased safety, mating opportunities, and access to resources. AsCharles Darwin noted, \u201cIn the long history of humankind, those wholearned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.\u201dAs a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And thisancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modernbehavior.", "We don\u2019t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow thescript handed down by our friends and family, our church or school,our local community and society at large. Each of these cultures andgroups comes with its own set of expectations and standards\u2014whenand whether to get married, how many children to have, whichholidays to celebrate, how much money to spend on your child\u2019sbirthday party. In many ways, these social norms are the invisible rulesthat guide your behavior each day. You\u2019re always keeping them inmind, even if they are at the not top of your mind. Often, you follow thehabits of your culture without thinking, without questioning, andsometimes without remembering. As the French philosopher Michelde Montaigne wrote, \u201cThe customs and practices of life in societysweep us along.\u201dMost of the time, going along with the group does not feel like aburden. Everyone wants to belong. If you grow up in a family thatrewards you for your chess skills, playing chess will seem like a veryattractive thing to do.

Imitating the CloseProximity has a powerful effect on our behavior. This is true of thephysical environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6, but it is also trueof the social environment.We pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way ourparents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another,", "the way our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, yougive it a try, too. When your wife has a habit of double-checking thatthe door is locked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.I find that I often imitate the behavior of those around me withoutrealizing it. In conversation, I\u2019ll automatically assume the body postureof the other person. In college, I began to talk like my roommates.When traveling to other countries, I unconsciously imitate the localaccent despite reminding myself to stop.As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely weare to imitate some of their habits.

Another studyfound that if one person in a relationship lost weight, the other partnerwould also slim down about one third of the time. Our friends andfamily provide a sort of invisible peer pressure that pulls us in theirdirection.Of course, peer pressure is bad only if you\u2019re surrounded by badinfluences.

Imitating the ManyIn the 1950s, psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a series ofexperiments that are now taught to legions of undergrads each year. Tobegin each experiment, the subject entered the room with a group ofstrangers. Unbeknownst to them, the other participants were actorsplanted by the researcher and instructed to deliver scripted answers tocertain questions.The group would be shown one card with a line on it and then asecond card with a series of lines. Each person was asked to select theline on the second card that was similar in length to the line on the firstcard. It was a very simple task. Here is an example of two cards used inthe experiment:CONFORMING TO SOCIAL NORMS", "FIGURE 10: This is a representation of two cards used by Solomon Asch inhis famous social conformity experiments. The length of the line on the firstcard (left) is obviously the same as line C, but when a group of actorsclaimed it was a different length the research subjects would often changetheir minds and go with the crowd rather than believe their own eyes.The experiment always began the same. First, there would be someeasy trials where everyone agreed on the correct line. After a fewrounds, the participants were shown a test that was just as obvious asthe previous ones, except the actors in the room would select anintentionally incorrect answer. For example, they would respond \u201cA\u201dto the comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would agree that thelines were the same even though they were clearly different.The subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would immediatelybecome bewildered. Their eyes would open wide. They would laughnervously to themselves. They would double-check the reactions ofother participants. Their agitation would grow as one person afteranother delivered the same incorrect response. Soon, the subject beganto doubt their own eyes. Eventually, they delivered the answer theyknew in their heart to be incorrect.", "Asch ran this experiment many times and in many different ways.What he discovered was that as the number of actors increased, so didthe conformity of the subject. If it was just the subject and one actor,then there was no effect on the person\u2019s choice. They just assumed theywere in the room with a dummy. When two actors were in the roomwith the subject, there was still little impact. But as the number ofpeople increased to three actors and four and all the way to eight, thesubject became more likely to second-guess themselves. By the end ofthe experiment, nearly 75 percent of the subjects had agreed with thegroup answer even though it was obviously incorrect.Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guideour behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment andwondering, \u201cWhat is everyone else doing?\u201d We check reviews onAmazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the \u201cbest\u201dbuying, eating, and travel habits. It\u2019s usually a smart strategy. There isevidence in numbers.But there can be a downside.The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desiredbehavior of the individual. For example, one study found that when achimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts", "open as a member ofone group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effectivestrategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just toblend in with the rest of the chimps.Humans are similar. There is tremendous internal pressure tocomply with the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted isoften greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart,or finding truth. Most days, we\u2019d rather be wrong with the crowd thanbe right by ourselves.The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants toget along with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it\u2014you can choose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other peoplethink\u2014but it takes work. Running against the grain of your culturerequires extra effort.When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change isunattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with thetribe, change is very attractive.", "3. Imitating the PowerfulHumans everywhere pursue power, prestige, and status. We want pinsand medallions on our jackets. We want President or Partner in ourtitles. We want to be acknowledged, recognized, and praised. Thistendency can seem vain, but overall, it\u2019s a smart move. Historically, aperson with greater power and status has access to more resources,worries less about survival, and proves to be a more attractive mate.We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval,admiration, and status. We want to be the one in the gym who can domuscle-ups or the musician who can play the hardest chordprogressions or the parent with the most accomplished childrenbecause these things separate us from the crowd. Once we fit in, westart looking for ways to stand out.This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highlyeffective people. We try to copy the behavior of successful peoplebecause we desire success ourselves. Many of our daily habits areimitations of people we admire. You replicate the marketing strategiesof the most successful firms in your industry. You make a recipe fromyour favorite baker. You borrow the storytelling strategies of yourfavorite writer. You mimic the communication style of your boss. Weimitate people we envy.High-status people enjoy", "the approval, respect, and praise of others.And that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise,we find it attractive.We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower ourstatus. We trim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don\u2019t wantto be the slob of the neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit,we clean up the house because we don\u2019t want to be judged. We arecontinually wondering \u201cWhat will others think of me?\u201d and alteringour behavior based on the answer.The Polgar sisters\u2014the chess prodigies mentioned at the beginningof this chapter\u2014are evidence of the powerful and lasting impact socialinfluences can have on our behavior. The sisters practiced chess formany hours each day and continued this remarkable effort for decades.But these habits and behaviors maintained their attractiveness, in part,because they were valued by their culture. From the praise of their", "parents to the achievement of different status markers like becoming agrandmaster, they had many reasons to continue their effort.Chapter SummaryThe culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractiveto us.We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by ourculture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to thetribe.We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close(family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (thosewith status and prestige).One of the most effective things you can do to build better habitsis to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normalbehavior and (2) you already have something in common with thegroup.The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desiredbehavior of the individual. Most days, we\u2019d rather be wrong withthe crowd than be right by ourselves.If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find itattractive.", "I 10How to Find and Fix the Causes of YourBad HabitsN LATE 2012, I was sitting in an old apartment just a few blocks fromIstanbul\u2019s most famous street, Istiklal Caddesi. I was in the middle ofa four-day trip to Turkey and my guide, Mike, was relaxing in a worn-out armchair a few feet away.Mike wasn\u2019t really a guide. He was just a guy from Maine who hadbeen living in Turkey for five years, but he offered to show me aroundwhile I was visiting the country and I took him up on it. On thisparticular night, I had been invited to dinner with him and a handful ofhis Turkish friends.There were seven of us, and I was the only one who hadn\u2019t, at somepoint, smoked at least one pack of cigarettes per day. I asked one of theTurks how he got started. \u201cFriends,\u201d he said. \u201cIt always starts with yourfriends. One friend smokes, then you try it.\u201dWhat was truly fascinating was that half of the people in the roomhad managed to quit smoking. Mike had been smoke-free for a fewyears at that point, and he swore up and down that he broke the habitbecause of a book called Allen Carr\u2019s Easy", "Way to Stop Smoking.\u201cIt frees you from the mental burden of smoking,\u201d he said. \u201cIt tellsyou: \u2018Stop lying to yourself.

You can be social without smoking at all.You think smoking is about relieving stress, but it\u2019s not. Smokingdoes not relieve your nerves, it destroys them.Over and over, he repeats these phrases and others like them. \u201cGetit clearly into your mind,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are losing nothing and you aremaking marvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and moneybut also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important ofall, in the length and quality of your future life.\u201dBy the time you get to the end of the book, smoking seems like themost ridiculous thing in the world to do. And if you no longer expectsmoking to bring you any benefits, you have no reason to smoke. It isan inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: make it unattractive.Now, I know this idea might sound overly simplistic. Just change yourmind and you can quit smoking. But stick with me for a minute.WHERE CRAVINGS", "COME FROMEvery behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlyingmotive. I often have a craving that goes something like this: \u201cI want toeat tacos.\u201d If you were to ask me why I want to eat tacos, I wouldn\u2019tsay, \u201cBecause I need food to survive.\u201d But the truth is, somewhere deepdown, I am motivated to eat tacos because I have to eat to survive. Theunderlying motive is to obtain food and water even if my specificcraving is for a taco.Some of our underlying motives include:*Conserve energyObtain food and water", "Find love and reproduceConnect and bond with othersWin social acceptance and approvalReduce uncertaintyAchieve status and prestigeA craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlyingmotive. Your brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes orto check Instagram or to play video games. At a deep level, you simplywant to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win socialacceptance and approval, or to achieve status.Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you\u2019ll see thatit does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto theunderlying motives of human nature.Find love and reproduce = using TinderConnect and bond with others = browsing FacebookWin social acceptance and approval = posting on InstagramReduce uncertainty = searching on GoogleAchieve status and prestige = playing video gamesYour habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. Newversions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behaviorremain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on theperiod of history.Here\u2019s the powerful part: there are many different ways to addressthe same underlying motive. One person might learn to reduce stressby smoking a cigarette. Another person learns to ease their anxiety bygoing for a run. Your current habits are not necessarily the best way tosolve the", "problems you face; they are just the methods you learned touse. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve,you keep coming back to it.Habits are all about associations. These associations determinewhether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we coveredin our discussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing", "information and noticing cues in the environment. Every time youperceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a predictionabout what to do in the next moment.Cue: You notice that the stove is hot.Prediction: If I touch it I\u2019ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.Cue: You see that the traffic light turned green.Prediction: If I step on the gas, I\u2019ll make it safely through theintersection and get closer to my destination, so I should step on thegas.You see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determinethe appropriate response.This all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role in yourhabits because every action is preceded by a prediction. Life feelsreactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making yourbest guess of how to act given what you\u2019ve just seen and what hasworked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting what willhappen in the next moment.Our behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions. Put anotherway, our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the eventsthat happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the eventsthemselves. Two people can look at the same cigarette, and one feelsthe urge to", "smoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The samecue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on yourprediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction thatprecedes them.These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typicallydescribe a craving\u2014a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotionstransform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into asignal that we can apply. They help explain what we are currentlysensing. For instance, whether or not you realize it, you are noticinghow warm or cold you feel right now. If the temperature drops by onedegree, you probably won\u2019t do anything. If the temperature drops tendegrees, however, you\u2019ll feel cold and put on another layer of clothing.Feeling cold was the signal that prompted you to act. You have beensensing the cues the entire time, but it is only when you predict thatyou would be better off in a different state that you take action.", "A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire tochange your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gapbetween what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to besensing. This gap between your current state and your desired stateprovides a reason to act.Desire is the difference between where you are now and where youwant to be in the future. Even the tiniest action is tinged with themotivation to feel differently than you do in the moment. When youbinge-eat or light up or browse social media, what you really want isnot a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch of likes. What you reallywant is to feel different.Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in ourcurrent state or to make a change. They help us decide the best courseof action. Neurologists have discovered that when emotions andfeelings are impaired, we actually lose the ability to make decisions.We have no signal of what to pursue and what to avoid. As theneuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, \u201cIt is emotion that allowsyou to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.\u201dTo summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you performare really an attempt", "to address your fundamental underlying motives.Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop acraving to do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking socialmedia will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow youto forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them withpositive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage ratherthan to our detriment.HOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD HABITSYou can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associatethem with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slightmind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have todo in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have tomake another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner foryour family.Now, imagine changing just one word: You don\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to. You\u201cget\u201d to.", "You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another salescall for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. Bysimply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. Youtransition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them intoopportunities.The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have todo those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence forwhatever mind-set we choose.I once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. Whenasked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, \u201cI\u2019m not confinedto my wheelchair\u2014I am liberated by it. If it wasn\u2019t for my wheelchair, Iwould be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.\u201d This shift inperspective completely transformed how he lived each day.Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than theirdrawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind andmake a habit seem more attractive.Exercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challengingtask that drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easilyview it as a way to develop skills and build you up. Instead of tellingyourself \u201cI need to go run in the morning,\u201d", "say \u201cIt\u2019s time to buildendurance and get fast.\u201dFinance. Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. However,you can associate it with freedom rather than limitation if you realizeone simple truth: living below your current means increases yourfuture means. The money you save this month increases yourpurchasing power next month.Meditation. Anyone who has tried meditation for more than threeseconds knows how frustrating it can be when the next distractioninevitably pops into your mind. You can transform frustration intodelight when you realize that each interruption gives you a chance topractice returning to your breath. Distraction is a good thing becauseyou need distractions to practice meditation.Pregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a bigpresentation or competing in an important event. They experiencequicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If weinterpret these feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and tenseup. If we interpret these feelings positively, then we can respond with", "fluidity and grace. You can reframe \u201cI am nervous\u201d to \u201cI am excitedand I\u2019m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.\u201dThese little mind-set shifts aren\u2019t magic, but they can help changethe feelings you associate with a particular habit or situation.If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivationritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something youenjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit ofmotivation. For instance, if you always play the same song beforehaving sex, then you\u2019ll begin to link the music with the act. Wheneveryou want to get in the mood, just press play.Ed Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh, benefited from asimilar strategy without knowing it. \u201cOdd realization,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMyfocus and concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on]while writing. I don\u2019t even have to play any music.\u201d Without realizingit, he was conditioning himself. In the beginning, he put hisheadphones on, played some music he enjoyed, and did focused work.After doing it five, ten, twenty times, putting his headphones onbecame a cue that he automatically associated with increased focus.The craving followed naturally.Athletes use similar strategies to get themselves in the mind-set toperform. During my", "baseball career, I developed a specific ritual ofstretching and throwing before each game. The whole sequence tookabout ten minutes, and I did it the same way every single time. While itphysically warmed me up to play, more importantly, it put me in theright mental state. I began to associate my pregame ritual with feelingcompetitive and focused. Even if I wasn\u2019t motivated beforehand, by thetime I was done with my ritual, I was in \u201cgame mode.\u201dYou can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want tofeel happier in general. Find something that makes you truly happy\u2014like petting your dog or taking a bubble bath\u2014and then create a shortroutine that you perform every time before you do the thing you love.Maybe you take three deep breaths and smile.Three deep breaths. Smile. Pet the dog. Repeat.Eventually, you\u2019ll begin to associate this breathe-and-smile routinewith being in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy.Once established, you can break it out anytime you need to changeyour emotional state. Stressed at work? Take three deep breaths and", "smile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit hasbeen built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little to do withthe original situation.The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is toreframe the associations you have about them. It\u2019s not easy, but if youcan reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit intoan attractive one.Chapter SummaryThe inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make itunattractive.Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeperunderlying motive.Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedesthem.

They would be graded solely on the amount ofwork they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally thenumber of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photoswould rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the\u201cquality\u201d group. They would be graded only on the excellence of theirwork. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester,but to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image.At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the bestphotos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester,these students were busy taking photos, experimenting withcomposition and lighting, testing out various methods in thedarkroom, and learning from their mistakes.

The two ideas sound similar, but they\u2019re not the same. Whenyou\u2019re in motion, you\u2019re planning and strategizing and learning. Thoseare all good things, but they don\u2019t produce a result.Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver anoutcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that\u2019smotion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that\u2019s action. If Isearch for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that\u2019smotion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that\u2019s action.Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcomeby itself. It doesn\u2019t matter how many times you go talk to the personaltrainer, that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action ofworking out will get the result you\u2019re looking to achieve.If motion doesn\u2019t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we doit because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often thannot, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we\u2019re makingprogress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts atavoiding criticism. It doesn\u2019t", "feel good to fail or to be judged publicly,so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen. And that\u2019s thebiggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: youwant to delay failure.It\u2019s easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you\u2019re stillmaking progress. You think, \u201cI\u2019ve got conversations going with fourpotential clients right now. This is good. We\u2019re moving in the rightdirection.\u201d Or, \u201cI brainstormed some ideas for that book I want towrite. This is coming together.\u201dMotion makes you feel like you\u2019re getting things done. But really,you\u2019re just preparing to get something done. When preparationbecomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. Youdon\u2019t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, notperfection. You don\u2019t need to map out every feature of a new habit. Youjust need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: youjust need to get your reps in.HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY TAKE TO FORM A NEW HABIT?", "Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomesprogressively more automatic through repetition. The more you repeatan activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to becomeefficient at that activity. Neuroscientists call this long-termpotentiation, which refers to the strengthening of connections betweenneurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity. With eachrepetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and the neural connectionstighten. First described by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949,this phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb\u2019s Law: \u201cNeurons thatfire together wire together.\u201dRepeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. Inmusicians, the cerebellum\u2014critical for physical movements likeplucking a guitar string or pulling a violin bow\u2014is larger than it is innonmusicians. Mathematicians, meanwhile, have increased graymatter in the inferior parietal lobule, which plays a key role incomputation and calculation. Its size is directly correlated with theamount of time spent in the field; the older and more experienced themathematician, the greater the increase in gray matter.When scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, theyfound that the hippocampus\u2014a region of the brain involved in spatialmemory\u2014was significantly larger in their subjects than in non\u2013taxidrivers. Even more fascinating, the hippocampus decreased in sizewhen a driver retired. Like the muscles of the", "body responding toregular weight training, particular regions of the brain adapt as theyare used and atrophy as they are abandoned.Of course, the importance of repetition in establishing habits wasrecognized long before neuroscientists began poking around. In 1860,the English philosopher George H. Lewes noted, \u201cIn learning to speaka new language, to play on a musical instrument, or to performunaccustomed movements, great difficulty is felt, because the channelsthrough which each sensation has to pass have not becomeestablished; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a pathway, thanthis difficulty vanishes; the actions become so automatic that they canbe performed while the mind is otherwise engaged.\u201d Both commonsense and scientific evidence agree: repetition is a form of change.Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particularneural circuit associated with that habit. This means that simplyputting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to", "encoding a new habit. It is why the students who took tons of photosimproved their skills while those who merely theorized about perfectphotos did not. One group engaged in active practice, the other inpassive learning. One in action, the other in motion.All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice toautomatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity isthe ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step,which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.It looks something like this:THE HABIT LINE FIGURE 11: In the beginning (point A), a habit requires a good deal of effortand concentration to perform. After a few repetitions (point B), it gets easier,but still requires some conscious attention. With enough practice (point C),the habit becomes more automatic than conscious. Beyond this threshold\u2014the habit line\u2014the behavior can be done more or less without thinking. Anew habit has been formed.On the following page, you\u2019ll see what it looks like when researcherstrack the level of automaticity for an actual habit like walking for tenminutes each day. The shape of these charts, which scientists call", "learning curves, reveals an important truth about behavior change:habits form based on frequency, not time.WALKING 10 MINUTES PER DAY FIGURE 12: This graph shows someone who built the habit of walking forten minutes after breakfast each day. Notice that as the repetitions increase,so does automaticity, until the behavior is as easy and automatic as it canbe.One of the most common questions I hear is, \u201cHow long does it taketo build a new habit?\u201d But what people really should be asking is, \u201cHowmany does it take to form a new habit?\u201d That is, how many repetitionsare required to make a habit automatic?There is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habitformation. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s been twenty-one days or thirty daysor three hundred days. What matters is the rate at which you performthe behavior. You could do something twice in thirty days, or twohundred times. It\u2019s the frequency that makes the difference. Yourcurrent habits have been internalized over the course of hundreds, ifnot thousands, of repetitions. New habits require the same level offrequency. You need to string together enough successful attemptsuntil the behavior is firmly embedded in your mind and you cross theHabit Line.", "In practice, it doesn\u2019t really matter how long it takes for a habit tobecome automatic. What matters is that you take the actions you needto take to make progress. Whether an action is fully automatic is of lessimportance.To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective wayto make practice happen is to adhere to the 3rd Law of BehaviorChange: make it easy. The chapters that follow will show you how todo exactly that.Chapter SummaryThe 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy.The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.Focus on taking action, not being in motion.Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomesprogressively more automatic through repetition.The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not asimportant as the number of times you have performed it.", "I 12The Law of Least EffortN HIS AWARD-WINNING BOOK, Guns, Germs, and Steel, anthropologistand biologist Jared Diamond points out a simple fact: differentcontinents have different shapes. At first glance, this statement seemsrather obvious and unimportant, but it turns out to have a profoundimpact on human behavior.The primary axis of the Americas runs from north to south. That is,the landmass of North and South America tends to be tall and thinrather than wide and fat. The same is generally true for Africa.Meanwhile, the landmass that makes up Europe, Asia, and the MiddleEast is the opposite. This massive stretch of land tends to be more east-west in shape. According to Diamond, this difference in shape played asignificant role in the spread of agriculture over the centuries.When agriculture began to spread around the globe, farmers had aneasier time expanding along east-west routes than along north-southones. This is because locations along the same latitude generally sharesimilar climates, amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes inseason. These factors allowed farmers in Europe and Asia todomesticate a few crops and grow them along the entire stretch of landfrom France to China.THE SHAPE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR"]}, "chapter 13": {"name": "The Law of Least Effort", "text": ["FIGURE 13: The primary axis of Europe and Asia is east-west. The primaryaxis of the Americas and Africa is north-south. This leads to a wider range ofclimates up-and-down the Americas than across Europe and Asia. As aresult, agriculture spread nearly twice as fast across Europe and Asia than itdid elsewhere. The behavior of farmers\u2014even across hundreds orthousands of years\u2014was constrained by the amount of friction in theenvironment.By comparison, the climate varies greatly when traveling from northto south. Just imagine how different the weather is in Floridacompared to Canada. You can be the most talented farmer in theworld, but it won\u2019t help you grow Florida oranges in the Canadianwinter. Snow is a poor substitute for soil. In order to spread cropsalong north-south routes, farmers would need to find and domesticatenew plants whenever the climate changed.As a result, agriculture spread two to three times faster across Asiaand Europe than it did up and down the Americas. Over the span ofcenturies, this small difference had a very big impact. Increased foodproduction allowed for more rapid population growth. With morepeople, these cultures were able to build stronger armies and werebetter equipped to develop new technologies. The changes started out", "small\u2014a crop that spread slightly farther, a population that grewslightly faster\u2014but compounded into substantial differences over time.The spread of agriculture provides an example of the 3rd Law ofBehavior Change on a global scale. Conventional wisdom holds thatmotivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it,you\u2019d actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazyand to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest productivitybest seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one.Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it wheneverpossible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, whichstates that when deciding between two similar options, people willnaturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount ofwork.* For example, expanding your farm to the east where you cangrow the same crops rather than heading north where the climate isdifferent. Out of all the possible actions we could take, the one that isrealized is the one that delivers the most value for the least effort. Weare motivated to do what is easy.Every action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energyrequired, the less likely it is to occur.", "If your goal is to do a hundredpush-ups per day, that\u2019s a lot of energy! In the beginning, when you\u2019remotivated and excited, you can muster the strength to get started. Butafter a few days, such a massive effort feels exhausting. Meanwhile,sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per day requires almost noenergy to get started. And the less energy a habit requires, the morelikely it is to occur.Look at any behavior that fills up much of your life and you\u2019ll seethat it can be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits likescrolling on our phones, checking email, and watching television stealso much of our time because they can be performed almost withouteffort. They are remarkably convenient.In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you reallywant. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle tofeeling calm. Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. You don\u2019tactually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome thehabit delivers. The greater the obstacle\u2014that is, the more difficult thehabit\u2014the more friction there is between you and your desired endstate. This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that you\u2019ll do", "them even when you don\u2019t feel like it. If you can make your good habitsmore convenient, you\u2019ll be more likely to follow through on them.But what about all the moments when we seem to do the opposite?If we\u2019re all so lazy, then how do you explain people accomplishing hardthings like raising a child or starting a business or climbing MountEverest?Certainly, you are capable of doing very hard things. The problem isthat some days you feel like doing the hard work and some days youfeel like giving in. On the tough days, it\u2019s crucial to have as many thingsworking in your favor as possible so that you can overcome thechallenges life naturally throws your way. The less friction you face, theeasier it is for your stronger self to emerge. The idea behind make iteasy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy aspossible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run.HOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFORTImagine you are holding a garden hose that is bent in the middle.Some water can flow through, but not very much. If you want toincrease the rate at which water passes through the hose,", "you have twooptions. The first option is to crank up the valve and force more waterout. The second option is to simply remove the bend in the hose and letwater flow through naturally.Trying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard habit is liketrying to force water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it requiresa lot of effort and increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile, makingyour habits simple and easy is like removing the bend in the hose.Rather than trying to overcome the friction in your life, you reduce it.One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated withyour habits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, wediscussed environment design as a method for making cues moreobvious, but you can also optimize your environment to make actionseasier. For example, when deciding where to practice a new habit, it isbest to choose a place that is already along the path of your dailyroutine. Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of yourlife. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way to workbecause stopping doesn\u2019t add much friction to your lifestyle. By", "comparison, if the gym is off the path of your normal commute\u2014evenby just a few blocks\u2014now you\u2019re going \u201cout of your way\u201d to get there.Perhaps even more effective is reducing the friction within yourhome or office. Too often, we try to start habits in high-frictionenvironments. We try to follow a strict diet while we are out to dinnerwith friends. We try to write a book in a chaotic household. We try toconcentrate while using a smartphone filled with distractions. Itdoesn\u2019t have to be this way. We can remove the points of friction thathold us back. This is precisely what electronics manufacturers in Japanbegan to do in the 1970s.In an article published in the New Yorker titled \u201cBetter All theTime,\u201d James Suroweicki writes:\u201cJapanese firms emphasized what came to be known as \u2018leanproduction,\u2019 relentlessly looking to remove waste of all kinds from theproduction process, down to redesigning workspaces, so workersdidn\u2019t have to waste time twisting and turning to reach their tools. Theresult was that Japanese factories were more efficient and Japaneseproducts were more reliable than American ones. In 1974, service callsfor American-made color televisions were five times as common as forJapanese televisions. By 1979, it took American workers three times aslong to", "assemble their sets.\u201dI like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction.* TheJapanese companies looked for every point of friction in themanufacturing process and eliminated it. As they subtracted wastedeffort, they added customers and revenue. Similarly, when we removethe points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achievemore with less effort. (This is one reason tidying up can feel so good:we are simultaneously moving forward and lightening the cognitiveload our environment places on us.)If you look at the most habit-forming products, you\u2019ll notice thatone of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bitsof friction from your life. Meal delivery services reduce the friction ofshopping for groceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of makingsocial introductions. Ride-sharing services reduce the friction ofgetting across town. Text messaging reduces the friction of sending aletter in the mail.", "Like a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning theirworkspace to reduce wasted motion, successful companies design theirproducts to automate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible.They reduce the number of fields on each form. They pare down thenumber of clicks required to create an account. They deliver theirproducts with easy-to-understand directions or ask their customers tomake fewer choices.When the first voice-activated speakers were released\u2014productslike Google Home, Amazon Echo, and Apple HomePod\u2014I asked afriend what he liked about the product he had purchased. He said itwas just easier to say \u201cPlay some country music\u201d than to pull out hisphone, open the music app, and pick a playlist. Of course, just a fewyears earlier, having unlimited access to music in your pocket was aremarkably frictionless behavior compared to driving to the store andbuying a CD. Business is a never-ending quest to deliver the sameresult in an easier fashion.Similar strategies have been used effectively by governments. Whenthe British government wanted to increase tax collection rates, theyswitched from sending citizens to a web page where the tax form couldbe downloaded to linking directly to the form. Reducing that one stepin the process increased the response rate from 19.2 percent to 23.4percent. For a country like", "the United Kingdom, those percentagepoints represent millions in tax revenue.The central idea is to create an environment where doing the rightthing is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habitscomes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with ourgood habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.PRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USEOswald Nuckols is an IT developer from Natchez, Mississippi. He isalso someone who understands the power of priming his environment.Nuckols dialed in his cleaning habits by following a strategy herefers to as \u201cresetting the room.\u201d For instance, when he finisheswatching television, he places the remote back on the TV stand,arranges the pillows on the couch, and folds the blanket. When heleaves his car, he throws any trash away. Whenever he takes a shower,he wipes down the toilet while the shower is warming up. (As he notes,", "the \u201cperfect time to clean the toilet is right before you wash yourself inthe shower anyway.\u201d) The purpose of resetting each room is not simplyto clean up after the last action, but to prepare for the next action.\u201cWhen I walk into a room everything is in its right place,\u201d Nuckolswrote. \u201cBecause I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays ingood shape. . . . People think I work hard but I\u2019m actually really lazy.I\u2019m just proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.\u201dWhenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you arepriming it to make the next action easy. For instance, my wife keeps abox of greeting cards that are presorted by occasion\u2014birthday,sympathy, wedding, graduation, and more. Whenever necessary, shegrabs an appropriate card and sends it off. She is incredibly good atremembering to send cards because she has reduced the friction ofdoing so. For years, I was the opposite. Someone would have a babyand I would think, \u201cI should send a card.\u201d But then weeks would passand by the time I remembered to pick one up at the store, it was toolate. The habit wasn\u2019t easy.There are many ways to prime your environment so it\u2019s", "ready forimmediate use. If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, place the skilleton the stove, set the cooking spray on the counter, and lay out anyplates and utensils you\u2019ll need the night before. When you wake up,making breakfast will be easy.Want to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, anddrawing tools on top of your desk, within easy reach.Want to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag,and water bottle ahead of time.Want to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetableson weekends and pack them in containers, so you have easyaccess to healthy, ready-to-eat options during the week.These are simple ways to make the good habit the path of leastresistance.You can also invert this principle and prime the environment tomake bad behaviors difficult. If you find yourself watching too muchtelevision, for example, then unplug it after each use. Only plug it back", "in if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch. Thissetup creates just enough friction to prevent mindless viewing.If that doesn\u2019t do it, you can take it a step further. Unplug thetelevision and take the batteries out of the remote after each use, so ittakes an extra ten seconds to turn it back on. And if you\u2019re really hard-core, move the television out of the living room and into a closet aftereach use. You can be sure you\u2019ll only take it out when you really wantto watch something. The greater the friction, the less likely the habit.Whenever possible, I leave my phone in a different room untillunch. When it\u2019s right next to me, I\u2019ll check it all morning for no reasonat all. But when it is in another room, I rarely think about it. And thefriction is high enough that I won\u2019t go get it without a reason. As aresult, I get three to four hours each morning when I can work withoutinterruption.If sticking your phone in another room doesn\u2019t seem like enough,tell a friend or family member to hide it from you for a few hours. Ask acoworker to keep it at their", "desk in the morning and give it back to youat lunch.It is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent unwantedbehavior. When I hide beer in the back of the fridge where I can\u2019t see it,I drink less. When I delete social media apps from my phone, it can beweeks before I download them again and log in. These tricks areunlikely to curb a true addiction, but for many of us, a little bit offriction can be the difference between sticking with a good habit orsliding into a bad one. Imagine the cumulative impact of makingdozens of these changes and living in an environment designed tomake the good behaviors easier and the bad behaviors harder.Whether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, aparent, a coach, or a leader, we should ask ourselves the samequestion: \u201cHow can we design a world where it\u2019s easy to do what\u2019sright?\u201d Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also theactions that are easiest to do.Chapter SummaryHuman behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturallygravitate toward the option that requires the least amount ofwork.", "Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy aspossible.Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors.

The most effectiveway I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule,which states, \u201cWhen you start a new habit, it should take less than twominutes to do.\u201dYou\u2019ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute version:\u201cRead before bed each night\u201d becomes \u201cRead one page.\u201d\u201cDo thirty minutes of yoga\u201d becomes \u201cTake out my yoga mat.\u201d\u201cStudy for class\u201d becomes \u201cOpen my notes.\u201d\u201cFold the laundry\u201d becomes \u201cFold one pair of socks.\u201d\u201cRun three miles\u201d becomes \u201cTie my running shoes.\u201dThe idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyonecan meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothingaway. And, as we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategybecause once you\u2019ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier tocontinue doing it. A new habit should not feel like a challenge.

But the point is notto do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. Thetruth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If youcan\u2019t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope ofmastering the finer details. Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habitfrom the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You haveto standardize before you can optimize.As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simplybecome a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merelya hack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master adifficult skill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, themore likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focusthat is required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up beforeevery workout,", "you make it easier to get into a state of peakperformance. By following the same creative ritual, you make it easierto get into the hard work of creating. By developing a consistentpower-down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable timeeach night. You may not be able to automate the whole process, butyou can make the first action mindless. Make it easy to start and therest will follow.The Two-Minute Rule can seem like a trick to some people. Youknow that the real goal is to do more than just two minutes, so it mayfeel like you\u2019re trying to fool yourself. Nobody is actually aspiring toread one page or do one push-up or open their notes. And if you knowit\u2019s a mental trick, why would you fall for it?If the Two-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutesand then stop. Go for a run, but you must stop after two minutes. Startmeditating, but you must stop after two minutes. Study Arabic, but you", "must stop after two minutes. It\u2019s not a strategy for starting, it\u2019s thewhole thing. Your habit can only last one hundred and twenty seconds.One of my readers used this strategy to lose over one hundredpounds. In the beginning, he went to the gym each day, but he toldhimself he wasn\u2019t allowed to stay for more than five minutes. He wouldgo to the gym, exercise for five minutes, and leave as soon as his timewas up. After a few weeks, he looked around and thought, \u201cWell, I\u2019malways coming here anyway. I might as well start staying a littlelonger.\u201d A few years later, the weight was gone.Journaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can benefitfrom getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, but mostpeople give up after a few days or avoid it entirely because journalingfeels like a chore.* The secret is to always stay below the point where itfeels like work. Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant from theUnited Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by specifically writingless than he felt like. He always stopped journaling before it seemedlike a hassle. Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kindof writing. \u201cThe best way is to always stop when you", "are going good,\u201dhe said.Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce theidentity you want to build. If you show up at the gym five days in a row\u2014even if it\u2019s just for two minutes\u2014you are casting votes for your newidentity. You\u2019re not worried about getting in shape. You\u2019re focused onbecoming the type of person who doesn\u2019t miss workouts. You\u2019re takingthe smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be.We rarely think about change this way because everyone isconsumed by the end goal. But one push-up is better than notexercising. One minute of guitar practice is better than none at all. Oneminute of reading is better than never picking up a book. It\u2019s better todo less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.At some point, once you\u2019ve established the habit and you\u2019re showingup each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a techniquewe call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimategoal. Start by mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version ofthe behavior. Then, advance to an intermediate step and repeat theprocess\u2014focusing on just the first two minutes and mastering thatstage before moving on to the next level.", "Eventually, you\u2019ll end up with", "the habit you had originally hoped to build while still keeping yourfocus where it should be: on the first two minutes of the behavior.EXAMPLES OF HABIT SHAPINGBecoming an Early RiserPhase 1: Be home by 10 p.m. every night.Phase 2: Have all devices (TV, phone, etc.) turned off by 10 p.m. every night.Phase 3: Be in bed by 10 p.m. every night (reading a book, talking with your partner).Phase 4: Lights off by 10 p.m. every night.Phase 5: Wake up at 6 a.m. every day.Becoming VeganPhase 1: Start eating vegetables at each meal.Phase 2: Stop eating animals with four legs (cow, pig, lamb, etc.).Phase 3: Stop eating animals with two legs (chicken, turkey, etc.).Phase 4: Stop eating animals with no legs (fish, clams, scallops, etc.).Phase 5: Stop eating all animal products (eggs, milk, cheese).Starting to ExercisePhase 1: Change into workout clothes.Phase 2: Step out the door (try taking a walk).Phase 3: Drive to the gym, exercise for five minutes, and leave.Phase 4: Exercise for fifteen minutes at least once per week.Phase 5: Exercise three times per week.Nearly any larger life goal can be transformed into a two-minutebehavior.

He spent hischildhood doing chores on the family farm and working shifts at hisfather\u2019s sawmill. After attending college at Dartmouth, Pattersonreturned to Ohio and opened a small supply store for coal miners.", "It seemed like a good opportunity. The store faced little competitionand enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to makemoney. That was when Patterson discovered his employees werestealing from him.In the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common problem. Receiptswere kept in an open drawer and could easily be altered or discarded.There were no video cameras to review behavior and no software totrack transactions. Unless you were willing to hover over youremployees every minute of the day, or to manage all transactionsyourself, it was difficult to prevent theft.As Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came across anadvertisement for a new invention called Ritty\u2019s Incorruptible Cashier.Designed by fellow Dayton resident James Ritty, it was the first cashregister. The machine automatically locked the cash and receipts insideafter each transaction. Patterson bought two for fifty dollars each.Employee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the next sixmonths, Patterson\u2019s business went from losing money to making$5,000 in profit\u2014the equivalent of more than $100,000 today.Patterson was so impressed with the machine that he changedbusinesses. He bought the rights to Ritty\u2019s invention and opened theNational Cash Register Company.

By 1998,over nine million people called it home. It was the economic center ofPakistan and a transportation hub, with some of the most activeairports and seaports in the region. In the commercial parts of town,you could find all of the standard urban amenities and bustlingdowntown streets. But Karachi was also one of the least livable cities inthe world.Over 60 percent of Karachi\u2019s residents lived in squatter settlementsand slums. These densely packed neighborhoods were filled withmakeshift houses cobbled together from old boards, cinder blocks, andother discarded materials. There was no waste removal system, noelectricity grid, no clean water supply. When dry, the streets were acombination of dust and trash. When wet, they became a muddy pit ofsewage. Mosquito colonies thrived in pools of stagnant water, andchildren played among the garbage.The unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and disease.Contaminated water sources caused epidemics of diarrhea, vomiting,and abdominal pain. Nearly one third of the children living there weremalnourished. With so many people crammed into", "such a small space,viruses and bacterial infections spread rapidly. It was this public healthcrisis that had brought Stephen Luby to Pakistan.Luby and his team realized that in an environment with poorsanitation, the simple habit of washing your hands could make a real", "difference in the health of the residents. But they soon discovered thatmany people were already aware that handwashing was important.And yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were washing theirhands in a haphazard fashion. Some people would just run their handsunder the water quickly. Others would only wash one hand. Manywould simply forget to wash their hands before preparing food.Everyone said handwashing was important, but few people made ahabit out of it. The problem wasn\u2019t knowledge. The problem wasconsistency.That was when Luby and his team partnered with Procter & Gambleto supply the neighborhood with Safeguard soap. Compared to yourstandard bar of soap, using Safeguard was a more enjoyableexperience.\u201cIn Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,\u201d Luby told me. \u201cThestudy participants commonly mentioned how much they liked it.\u201d Thesoap foamed easily, and people were able to lather their hands withsuds. It smelled great. Instantly, handwashing became slightly morepleasurable.\u201cI see the goal of handwashing promotion not as behavior changebut as habit adoption,\u201d Luby said. \u201cIt is a lot easier for people to adopta product that provides a strong positive sensory signal, for examplethe mint taste of toothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does notprovide pleasurable sensory feedback, like flossing one\u2019s teeth.", "Themarketing team at Procter & Gamble talked about trying to create apositive handwashing experience.\u201dWithin months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the health ofchildren in the neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent;pneumonia by 48 percent; and impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, by35 percent.The long-term effects were even better. \u201cWe went back to some ofthe households in Karachi six years after,\u201d Luby told me. \u201cOver 95percent of households who had been given the soap for free andencouraged to wash their hands had a handwashing station with soapand water available when our study team visited. . . . We had not givenany soap to the intervention group for over five years, but during thetrial they had become so habituated to wash their hands, that they had", "maintained the practice.\u201d It was a powerful example of the fourth andfinal Law of Behavior Change: make it satisfying.We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience issatisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure\u2014even minorones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and latherswell\u2014are signals that tell the brain: \u201cThis feels good. Do this again,next time.\u201d Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worthremembering and repeating.Take the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been soldcommercially throughout the 1800s, but it wasn\u2019t until Wrigleylaunched in 1891 that it became a worldwide habit. Early versions weremade from relatively bland resins\u2014chewy, but not tasty. Wrigleyrevolutionized the industry by adding flavors like Spearmint and JuicyFruit, which made the product flavorful and fun to use. Then they wenta step further and began pushing chewing gum as a pathway to a cleanmouth. Advertisements told readers to \u201cRefresh Your Taste.\u201dTasty flavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits ofimmediate reinforcement and made the product satisfying to use.Consumption skyrocketed, and Wrigley became the largest chewinggum company in the world.Toothpaste had a similar trajectory. Manufacturers enjoyed greatsuccess when they added flavors like spearmint, peppermint, andcinnamon to their products. These", "flavors don\u2019t improve theeffectiveness of toothpaste. They simply create a \u201cclean mouth\u201d feeland make the experience of brushing your teeth more pleasurable. Mywife actually stopped using Sensodyne because she didn\u2019t like theaftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger mint flavor, whichproved to be more satisfying.Conversely, if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason torepeat it. In my research, I came across the story of a woman who hada narcissistic relative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend lesstime with this egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possiblewhenever he was around. Within a few encounters, he started avoidingher because he found her so uninteresting.Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of BehaviorChange: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided.You learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded", "for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotionscultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.The first three laws of behavior change\u2014make it obvious, make itattractive, and make it easy\u2014increase the odds that a behavior will beperformed this time. The fourth law of behavior change\u2014make itsatisfying\u2014increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated nexttime. It completes the habit loop.But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type ofsatisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.THE MISMATCH BETWEEN IMMEDIATE AND DELAYEDREWARDSImagine you\u2019re an animal roaming the plains of Africa\u2014a giraffe or anelephant or a lion. On any given day, most of your decisions have animmediate impact. You are always thinking about what to eat or whereto sleep or how to avoid a predator. You are constantly focused on thepresent or the very near future. You live in what scientists call animmediate-return environment because your actions instantly deliverclear and immediate outcomes.Now switch back to your human self. In modern society, many ofthe choices you make today will not benefit you immediately. If you doa good job at work, you\u2019ll get a paycheck in a few weeks. If you exercisetoday, perhaps you won\u2019t be overweight next year. If you", "save moneynow, maybe you\u2019ll have enough for retirement decades from now. Youlive in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because youcan work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-returnenvironment. The earliest remains of modern humans, known asHomo sapiens sapiens, are approximately two hundred thousand yearsold. These were the first humans to have a brain relatively similar toours. In particular, the neocortex\u2014the newest part of the brain and theregion responsible for higher functions like language\u2014was roughly thesame size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are walkingaround with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.It is only recently\u2014during the last five hundred years or so\u2014thatsociety has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment.*", "Compared to the age of the brain, modern society is brand-new. In thelast one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane,the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone,and Beyonc\u00e9. The world has changed much in recent years, but humannature has changed little.Similar to other animals on the African savannah, our ancestorsspent their days responding to grave threats, securing the next meal,and taking shelter from a storm. It made sense to place a high value oninstant gratification. The distant future was less of a concern. And afterthousands of generations in an immediate-return environment, ourbrains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones.Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency.That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent acrosstime.* You value the present more than the future. Usually, thistendency serves us well. A reward that is certain right now is typicallyworth more than one that is merely possible in the future. Butoccasionally, our bias toward instant gratification causes problems.Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lungcancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases theirrisk of obesity? Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know itcan result", "in sexually transmitted disease? Once you understand howthe brain prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: theconsequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards areimmediate. Smoking might kill you in ten years, but it reduces stressand eases your nicotine cravings now. Overeating is harmful in thelong run but appetizing in the moment. Sex\u2014safe or not\u2014providespleasure right away. Disease and infection won\u2019t show up for days orweeks, even years.Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately,these outcomes are often misaligned. With our bad habits, theimmediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feelsbad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome isunenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good. The Frencheconomist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when hewrote, \u201cIt almost always happens that when the immediateconsequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, andvice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the morebitter are its later fruits.\u201d", "Put another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present.The costs of your bad habits are in the future.The brain\u2019s tendency to prioritize the present moment means youcan\u2019t rely on good intentions. When you make a plan\u2014to lose weight,write a book, or learn a language\u2014you are actually making plans foryour future self. And when you envision what you want your life to belike, it is easy to see the value in taking actions with long-term benefits.We all want better lives for our future selves. However, when themoment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins. You areno longer making a choice for Future You, who dreams of being fitteror wealthier or happier. You are choosing for Present You, who wantsto be full, pampered, and entertained. As a general rule, the moreimmediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly youshould question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.*With a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to repeat somebehaviors and avoid others, let\u2019s update the Cardinal Rule of BehaviorChange: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What isimmediately punished is avoided.Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truthabout success: because of how we are wired, most people", "will spend allday chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the roadof delayed gratification. If you\u2019re willing to wait for the rewards, you\u2019llface less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes,the last mile is always the least crowded.This is precisely what research has shown. People who are better atdelaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substanceabuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, andsuperior social skills. We\u2019ve all seen this play out in our own lives. Ifyou delay watching television and get your homework done, you\u2019llgenerally learn more and get better grades. If you don\u2019t buy dessertsand chips at the store, you\u2019ll often eat healthier food when you gethome. At some point, success in nearly every field requires you toignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.Here\u2019s the problem: most people know that delaying gratification isthe wise approach. They want the benefits of good habits: to behealthy, productive, at peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-mind at the decisive moment. Thankfully, it\u2019s possible to train yourselfto delay gratification\u2014but you need to work with the grain of human", "nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit ofimmediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and alittle bit of immediate pain to ones that don\u2019t.HOW TO TURN INSTANT GRATIFICATION TO YOUR ADVANTAGEThe vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful\u2014even ifit\u2019s in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paidoff and that the work was worth the effort.In a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. Inthe real world, good habits tend to feel worthwhile only after they haveprovided you with something. Early on, it\u2019s all sacrifice. You\u2019ve gone tothe gym a few times, but you\u2019re not stronger or fitter or faster\u2014at least,not in any noticeable sense. It\u2019s only months later, once you shed a fewpounds or your arms gain some definition, that it becomes easier toexercise for its own sake. In the beginning, you need a reason to stayon track. This is why immediate rewards are essential. They keep youexcited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background.What we\u2019re really talking about here\u2014when we\u2019re discussingimmediate rewards\u2014is the ending of a behavior. The", "ending of anyexperience is vital because we tend to remember it more than otherphases. You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. The bestapproach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of usingan immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior. Habit stacking,which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue,which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your habit toan immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealingwith habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing.It can be challenging to stick with habits like \u201cno frivolous purchases\u201dor \u201cno alcohol this month\u201d because nothing happens when you skiphappy hour drinks or don\u2019t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard to feelsatisfied when there is no action in the first place. All you\u2019re doing isresisting temptation, and there isn\u2019t much satisfying about that.One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to makeavoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for somethingyou want\u2014maybe \u201cLeather Jacket.\u201d Whenever you pass on a purchase,put the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning", "latte? Transfer $5. Pass on another month of Netflix? Move $10 over.It\u2019s like creating a loyalty program for yourself. The immediate rewardof seeing yourself save money toward the leather jacket feels a lotbetter than being deprived. You are making it satisfying to do nothing.One of my readers and his wife used a similar setup. They wanted tostop eating out so much and start cooking together more. They labeledtheir savings account \u201cTrip to Europe.\u201d Whenever they skipped goingout to eat, they transferred $50 into the account. At the end of the year,they put the money toward the vacation.It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewardsthat reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it.Buying a new jacket is fine if you\u2019re trying to lose weight or read morebooks, but it doesn\u2019t work if you\u2019re trying to budget and save money.Instead, taking a bubble bath or going on a leisurely walk are goodexamples of rewarding yourself with free time, which aligns with yourultimate goal of more freedom and financial independence. Similarly,if your reward for exercising is eating a bowl of ice cream, then you\u2019recasting votes for conflicting identities, and it ends up being a wash.Instead, maybe your", "reward is a massage, which is both a luxury and avote toward taking care of your body. Now the short-term reward isaligned with your long-term vision of being a healthy person.Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy,and reduced stress kick in, you\u2019ll become less concerned with chasingthe secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. Youdo it because it\u2019s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more ahabit becomes part of your life, the less you need outsideencouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identitysustains a habit.That said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate and a newidentity to emerge. Immediate reinforcement helps maintainmotivation in the short term while you\u2019re waiting for the long-termrewards to arrive.In summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bitsof reinforcement\u2014like soap that smells great or toothpaste that has arefreshing mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account\u2014canoffer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change iseasy when it is enjoyable.", "Chapter SummaryThe 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience issatisfying.The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards overdelayed rewards.The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediatelyrewarded is repeated.

Abbotsford was a relatively smallsuburb, tucked away in the shadow of nearby Vancouver, where mostof the big business deals were being made. Given the location, and thefact that Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody expected too much of him. Buthe made brisk progress thanks to a simple daily habit.Dyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One wasfilled with 120 paper clips. The other was empty.

But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with ahabit tracker.HOW TO KEEP YOUR HABITS ON TRACKA habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit.The most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day youstick with your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday,Wednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by,the calendar becomes a record of your habit streak.Countless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps the mostfamous was Benjamin Franklin. Beginning at age twenty, Franklincarried a small booklet everywhere he went and used it to trackthirteen personal virtues. This list included goals like \u201cLose no time. Bealways employed in something useful\u201d and \u201cAvoid triflingconversation.\u201d At the end of each day, Franklin would open his bookletand record his progress.Jerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his streakof writing jokes. In the documentary Comedian, he explains that hisgoal is simply to \u201cnever break the chain\u201d of writing jokes every day. Inother words, he is not focused on how good", "or bad a particular joke isor how inspired he feels. He is simply focused on showing up andadding to his streak.\u201cDon\u2019t break the chain\u201d is a powerful mantra. Don\u2019t break the chainof sales calls and you\u2019ll build a successful book of business. Don\u2019t breakthe chain of workouts and you\u2019ll get fit faster than you\u2019d expect. Don\u2019tbreak the chain of creating every day and you will end up with animpressive portfolio. Habit tracking is powerful because it leveragesmultiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behaviorobvious, attractive, and satisfying.Let\u2019s break down each one.Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.", "Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your nextone. Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like thestreak of X\u2019s on your calendar or the list of meals in your food log.When you look at the calendar and see your streak, you\u2019ll be remindedto act again. Research has shown that people who track their progresson goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and lowering bloodpressure are all more likely to improve than those who don\u2019t. Onestudy of more than sixteen hundred people found that those who kepta daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did not. Themere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distortedview of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do.Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our ownbehavior and notice what\u2019s really going on each day. One glance at thepaper clips in the container and you immediately know how muchwork you have (or haven\u2019t) been putting in. When the evidence is rightin front of you, you\u2019re less likely to lie to yourself.Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.The most", "effective form of motivation is progress. When we get asignal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated tocontinue down that path. In this way, habit tracking can have anaddictive effect on motivation. Each small win feeds your desire.This can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you\u2019re feelingdown, it\u2019s easy to forget about all the progress you have already made.Habit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work\u2014a subtlereminder of how far you\u2019ve come. Plus, the empty square you see eachmorning can motivate you to get started because you don\u2019t want to loseyour progress by breaking the streak.Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.This is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its ownform of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, tocomplete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on thecalendar. It feels good to watch your results grow\u2014the size of your", "investment portfolio, the length of your book manuscript\u2014and if itfeels good, then you\u2019re more likely to endure.Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you\u2019re focusedon the process rather than the result. You\u2019re not fixated on getting six-pack abs, you\u2019re just trying to keep the streak alive and become thetype of person who doesn\u2019t miss workouts.In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remindyou to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progressyou are making and don\u2019t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfyingwhenever you record another successful instance of your habit.Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are castingvotes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightfulform of immediate and intrinsic gratification.*You may be wondering, if habit tracking is so useful, why have Iwaited so long to talk about it?Despite all the benefits, I\u2019ve left this discussion until now for asimple reason: many people resist the idea of tracking and measuring.It can feel like a burden because it forces you into two habits: the habityou\u2019re trying to build and the habit of tracking it. Counting caloriessounds like a hassle when you\u2019re already struggling to follow", "a diet.Writing down every sales call seems tedious when you\u2019ve got work todo. It feels easier to say, \u201cI\u2019ll just eat less.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019ll try harder.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019llremember to do it.\u201d People inevitably tell me things like, \u201cI have adecision journal, but I wish I used it more.\u201d Or, \u201cI recorded myworkouts for a week, but then quit.\u201d I\u2019ve been there myself. I oncemade a food log to track my calories. I managed to do it for one mealand then gave up.Tracking isn\u2019t for everyone, and there is no need to measure yourentire life. But nearly anyone can benefit from it in some form\u2014even ifit\u2019s only temporary.What can we do to make tracking easier?First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated. You\u2019llprobably be surprised by how much you\u2019re already tracking withoutknowing it. Your credit card statement tracks how often you go out toeat. Your Fitbit registers how many steps you take and how long yousleep. Your calendar records how many new places you travel to eachyear. Once you know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar", "to review it each week or each month, which is more practical thantracking it every day.Second, manual tracking should be limited to your most importanthabits. It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadicallytrack ten.Finally, record each measurement immediately after the habitoccurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. Thisapproach allows you to combine the habit-stacking method mentionedin Chapter 5 with habit tracking.The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].After I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move one paperclip over.After I finish each set at the gym, I will record it in my workoutjournal.After I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will write down what Iate.These tactics can make tracking your habits easier. Even if youaren\u2019t the type of person who enjoys recording your behavior, I thinkyou\u2019ll find a few weeks of measurements to be insightful. It\u2019s alwaysinteresting to see how you\u2019ve actually been spending your time.That said, every habit streak ends at some point. And, moreimportant than any single measurement, is having a good plan forwhen your habits slide off track.HOW TO RECOVER QUICKLY WHEN YOUR HABITS BREAKDOWNNo matter", "how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable thatlife will interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. Beforelong, an emergency will pop up\u2014you get sick or you have to travel forwork or your family needs a little more of your time.Whenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simplerule: never miss twice.", "If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible.Missing one workout happens, but I\u2019m not going to miss two in a row.Maybe I\u2019ll eat an entire pizza, but I\u2019ll follow it up with a healthy meal. Ican\u2019t be perfect, but I can avoid a second lapse. As soon as one streakends, I get started on the next one.The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral ofrepeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missingtwice is the start of a new habit.This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyonecan have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. Butwhen successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of ahabit doesn\u2019t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.I think this principle is so important that I\u2019ll stick to it even if I can\u2019tdo a habit as well or as completely as I would like. Too often, we fallinto an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is notslipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can\u2019t do somethingperfectly, then you shouldn\u2019t do it at all.You don\u2019t realize how valuable it", "is to just show up on your bad (orbusy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. Ifyou start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. Butyou only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In otherwords, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, \u201cThe first rule of compounding:Never interrupt it unnecessarily.\u201dThis is why the \u201cbad\u201d workouts are often the most important ones.Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains youaccrued from previous good days. Simply doing something\u2014tensquats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really\u2014is huge. Don\u2019t put up azero. Don\u2019t let losses eat into your compounding.Furthermore, it\u2019s not always about what happens during theworkout. It\u2019s about being the type of person who doesn\u2019t missworkouts. It\u2019s easy to train when you feel good, but it\u2019s crucial to showup when you don\u2019t feel like it\u2014even if you do less than you hope. Goingto the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but itreaffirms your identity.The all-or-nothing cycle of behavior change is just one pitfall thatcan derail your habits. Another potential danger\u2014especially if you are", "using a habit tracker\u2014is measuring the wrong thing.KNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO TRACK A HABITSay you\u2019re running a restaurant and you want to know if your chef isdoing a good job. One way to measure success is to track how manycustomers pay for a meal each day. If more customers come in, thefood must be good. If fewer customers come in, something must bewrong.However, this one measurement\u2014daily revenue\u2014only gives alimited picture of what\u2019s really going on. Just because someone paysfor a meal doesn\u2019t mean they enjoy the meal. Even dissatisfiedcustomers are unlikely to dine and dash. In fact, if you\u2019re onlymeasuring revenue, the food might be getting worse but you\u2019re makingup for it with marketing or discounts or some other method. Instead, itmay be more effective to track how many customers finish their mealor perhaps the percentage of customers who leave a generous tip.The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we becomedriven by the number rather than the purpose behind it. If yoursuccess is measured by quarterly earnings, you will optimize sales,revenue, and accounting for quarterly earnings. If your success ismeasured by a lower number on the scale, you will optimize for a lowernumber on the", "scale, even if that means embracing crash diets, juicecleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind wants to \u201cwin\u201d whatevergame is being played.This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on workinglong hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care moreabout getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. Weteach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity,and critical thinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure. Whenwe choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart\u2019s Law. Named after theeconomist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, \u201cWhen a measurebecomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\u201d Measurement is onlyuseful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, notwhen it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback inthe overall system.", "In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers andundervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. Wemistakenly think the factors we can measure are the only factors thatexist. But just because you can measure something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019sthe most important thing. And just because you can\u2019t measuresomething doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important at all.All of this to say, it\u2019s crucial to keep habit tracking in its properplace. It can feel satisfying to record a habit and track your progress,but the measurement is not the only thing that matters. Furthermore,there are many ways to measure progress, and sometimes it helps toshift your focus to something entirely different.This is why nonscale victories can be effective for weight loss. Thenumber on the scale may be stubborn, so if you focus solely on thatnumber, your motivation will sag. But you may notice that your skinlooks better or you wake up earlier or your sex drive got a boost. All ofthese are valid ways to track your improvement. If you\u2019re not feelingmotivated by the number on the scale, perhaps it\u2019s time to focus on adifferent measurement\u2014one that gives you more signals of progress.No matter how you measure your improvement, habit trackingoffers a simple way", "to make your habits more satisfying. Eachmeasurement provides a little bit of evidence that you\u2019re moving in theright direction and a brief moment of immediate pleasure for a job welldone.Chapter SummaryOne of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of makingprogress.A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did ahabit\u2014like marking an X on a calendar.Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can makeyour habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of yourprogress.Don\u2019t break the chain.

He founded the HarvardNegotiation Project and worked with numerous countries and worldleaders on peace resolutions, hostage crises, and diplomaticcompromises. But it was in the 1970s and 1980s, as the threat ofnuclear war escalated, that Fisher developed perhaps his mostinteresting idea.At the time, Fisher was focused on designing strategies that couldprevent nuclear war, and he had noticed a troubling fact. Any sittingpresident would have access to launch codes that could kill millions ofpeople but would never actually see anyone die because he wouldalways be thousands of miles away.\u201cMy suggestion was quite simple,\u201d he wrote in 1981. \u201cPut that[nuclear] code number in a little capsule, and then implant thatcapsule right next to the heart of a volunteer. The volunteer wouldcarry with him a big, heavy butcher knife as he accompanied thePresident. If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, theonly way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, tokill one human being. The President says, \u2018George, I\u2019m sorry but tensof millions must die.\u2019 He has to", "look at someone and realize what deathis\u2014what an innocent death is. Blood on the White House carpet. It\u2019sreality brought home."]}, "chapter 18": {"name": "How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything", "text": ["\u201cWhen I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, \u2018MyGod, that\u2019s terrible. Having to kill someone would distort thePresident\u2019s judgment. He might never push the button.\u2019\u201dThroughout our discussion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change wehave covered the importance of making good habits immediatelysatisfying. Fisher\u2019s proposal is an inversion of the 4th Law: Make itimmediately unsatisfying.Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the endingis satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when theending is painful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, itgets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The moreimmediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn fromit. The threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be good at his job.The possibility of a customer never returning makes restaurants creategood food. The cost of cutting the wrong blood vessel makes a surgeonmaster human anatomy and cut carefully. When the consequences aresevere, people learn quickly.The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If youwant to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, thenadding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their", "odds.We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and thatmakes them hard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome thispredicament is to increase the speed of the punishment associated withthe behavior. There can\u2019t be a gap between the action and theconsequences.As soon as actions incur an immediate consequence, behaviorbegins to change. Customers pay their bills on time when they arecharged a late fee. Students show up to class when their grade is linkedto attendance. We\u2019ll jump through a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit ofimmediate pain.There is, of course, a limit to this. If you\u2019re going to rely onpunishment to change behavior, then the strength of the punishmentmust match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct.To be productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than thecost of action. To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater thanthe cost of exercise. Getting fined for smoking in a restaurant or failing", "to recycle adds consequence to an action. Behavior only shifts if thepunishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.In general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate theconsequence, the more likely it is to influence individual behavior. Themore global, intangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the lesslikely it is to influence individual behavior.Thankfully, there is a straightforward way to add an immediate costto any bad habit: create a habit contract.THE HABIT CONTRACTThe first seat belt law was passed in New York on December 1, 1984. Atthe time, just 14 percent of people in the United States regularly wore aseat belt\u2014but that was all about to change.Within five years, over half of the nation had seat belt laws. Today,wearing a seat belt is enforceable by law in forty-nine of the fifty states.And it\u2019s not just the legislation, the number of people wearing seatbelts has changed dramatically as well. In 2016, over 88 percent ofAmericans buckled up each time they got in a car. In just over thirtyyears, there was a complete reversal in the habits of millions of people.Laws and regulations are an example of how government canchange our habits by creating a social contract. As a society, wecollectively agree to abide", "by certain rules and then enforce them as agroup. Whenever a new piece of legislation impacts behavior\u2014seat beltlaws, banning smoking inside restaurants, mandatory recycling\u2014it isan example of a social contract shaping our habits. The group agrees toact in a certain way, and if you don\u2019t follow along, you\u2019ll be punished.Just as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you cancreate a habit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract isa verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to aparticular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don\u2019t followthrough. Then you find one or two people to act as your accountabilitypartners and sign off on the contract with you.Bryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville, Tennessee, was thefirst person I saw put this strategy into action. Shortly after the birth ofhis son, Harris realized he wanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up ahabit contract between himself, his wife, and his personal trainer. The", "first version read, \u201cBryan\u2019s #1 objective for Q1 of 2017 is to start eatingcorrectly again so he feels better, looks better, and is able to hit hislong-term goal of 200 pounds at 10% body fat.\u201dBelow that statement, Harris laid out a road map for achieving hisideal outcome:Phase #1: Get back to a strict \u201cslow-carb\u201d diet in Q1.Phase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking program in Q2.Phase #3: Refine and maintain the details of his diet and workoutprogram in Q3.Finally, he wrote out each of the daily habits that would get him tohis goal. For example, \u201cWrite down all food that he consumes each dayand weigh himself each day.\u201dAnd then he listed the punishment if he failed: \u201cIf Bryan doesn\u2019t dothese two items then the following consequence will be enforced: Hewill have to dress up each workday and each Sunday morning for therest of the quarter. Dress up is defined as not wearing jeans, t-shirts,hoodies, or shorts. He will also give Joey (his trainer) $200 to use ashe sees fit if he misses one day of logging food.\u201dAt the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his trainer all signedthe contract.My initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed", "overlyformal and unnecessary, especially the signatures. But Harrisconvinced me that signing the contract was an indication ofseriousness. \u201cAnytime I skip this part,\u201d he said, \u201cI start slacking almostimmediately.\u201dThree months later, after hitting his targets for Q1, Harris upgradedhis goals. The consequences escalated, too. If he missed hiscarbohydrate and protein targets, he had to pay his trainer $100. Andif he failed to weigh himself, he had to give his wife $500 to use as shesaw fit. Perhaps most painfully, if he forgot to run sprints, he had todress up for work every day and wear an Alabama hat the rest of thequarter\u2014the bitter rival of his beloved Auburn team.The strategy worked. With his wife and trainer acting asaccountability partners and with the habit contract clarifying exactly", "what to do each day, Harris lost the weight.*To make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make thempainful in the moment. Creating a habit contract is a straightforwardway to do exactly that.Even if you don\u2019t want to create a full-blown habit contract, simplyhaving an accountability partner is useful. The comedian Margaret Chowrites a joke or song every day. She does the \u201csong a day\u201d challengewith a friend, which helps them both stay accountable. Knowing thatsomeone is watching can be a powerful motivator. You are less likely toprocrastinate or give up because there is an immediate cost. If youdon\u2019t follow through, perhaps they\u2019ll see you as untrustworthy or lazy.Suddenly, you are not only failing to uphold your promises to yourself,but also failing to uphold your promises to others.You can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, anentrepreneur in Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning.And if he doesn\u2019t, he has a tweet automatically scheduled that says,\u201cIt\u2019s 6:10 and I\u2019m not up because I\u2019m lazy! Reply to this for $5 viaPayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn\u2019t malfunction.\u201dWe are always trying to present our best selves to the world.

Wewant to get good grades and graduate from top schools to impresspotential employers and mates and our friends and family. We careabout the opinions of those around us because it helps if others like us.This is precisely why getting an accountability partner or signing ahabit contract can work so well.Chapter SummaryThe inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make itunsatisfying.We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful orunsatisfying.An accountability partner can create an immediate cost toinaction.

Phelps haswon more Olympic medals not only than any swimmer but also morethan any Olympian in any sport.Fewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but he was afantastic athlete in his own right. El Guerrouj is a Moroccan runnerwho holds two Olympic gold medals and is one of the greatest middle-distance runners of all time. For many years, he held the world recordin the mile, 1,500-meter, and 2,000-meter races. At the OlympicGames in Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won gold in the 1,500-meter and5,000-meter races.These two athletes are wildly different in many ways. (For starters,one competed on land and the other in water.) But most notably, theydiffer significantly in height. El Guerrouj is five feet, nine inches tall.Phelps is six feet, four inches tall. Despite this seven-inch difference inheight, the two men are identical in one respect: Michael Phelps andHicham El Guerrouj wear the same length inseam on their pants.How is this possible? Phelps has relatively short legs for his heightand a very long torso, the perfect build for swimming.", "El Guerrouj hasincredibly long legs and a short upper body, an ideal frame for distancerunning.Now, imagine if these world-class athletes were to switch sports.Given his remarkable athleticism, could Michael Phelps become anOlympic-caliber distance runner with enough training? It\u2019s unlikely. At"]}, "chapter 19": {"name": "The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don\"t)", "text": ["peak fitness, Phelps weighed 194 pounds, which is 40 percent heavierthan El Guerrouj, who competed at an ultralight 138 pounds. Tallerrunners are heavier runners, and every extra pound is a curse when itcomes to distance running. Against elite competition, Phelps would bedoomed from the start.Similarly, El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in history,but it\u2019s doubtful he would ever qualify for the Olympics as a swimmer.Since 1976, the average height of Olympic gold medalists in the men\u2019s1,500-meter run is five feet, ten inches. In comparison, the averageheight of Olympic gold medalists in the men\u2019s 100-meter freestyleswim is six feet, four inches. Swimmers tend to be tall and have longbacks and arms, which are ideal for pulling through the water. ElGuerrouj would be at a severe disadvantage before he ever touched thepool.The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the rightfield of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is withsports and business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfyingto stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations andabilities. Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on thetrack, you want to play a game where the odds", "are in your favor.Embracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truththat people are born with different abilities. Some people don\u2019t like todiscuss this fact. On the surface, your genes seem to be fixed, and it\u2019sno fun to talk about things you cannot control. Plus, phrases likebiological determinism makes it sound like certain individuals aredestined for success and others doomed to failure. But this is ashortsighted view of the influence of genes on behavior.The strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes cannot beeasily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage infavorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorablecircumstances. If you want to dunk a basketball, being seven feet tall isvery useful. If you want to perform a gymnastics routine, being sevenfeet tall is a great hindrance. Our environment determines thesuitability of our genes and the utility of our natural talents. When ourenvironment changes, so do the qualities that determine success.This is true not just for physical characteristics but for mental onesas well. I\u2019m smart if you ask me about habits and human behavior; not", "so much when it comes to knitting, rocket propulsion, or guitar chords.Competence is highly dependent on context.The people at the top of any competitive field are not only welltrained, they are also well suited to the task. And this is why, if youwant to be truly great, selecting the right place to focus is crucial.In short: genes do not determine your destiny. They determine yourareas of opportunity. As physician Gabor Mate notes, \u201cGenes canpredispose, but they don\u2019t predetermine.\u201d The areas where you aregenetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are morelikely to be satisfying. The key is to direct your effort toward areas thatboth excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambitionwith your ability.The obvious question is, \u201cHow do I figure out where the odds are inmy favor? How do I identify the opportunities and habits that are rightfor me?\u201d The first place we will look for an answer is by understandingyour personality.HOW YOUR PERSONALITY INFLUENCES YOUR HABITSYour genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed,beneath the surface of every behavior. Genes have been shown toinfluence everything from the number of hours you spend watchingtelevision to your likelihood to marry or divorce to", "your tendency to getaddicted to drugs, alcohol, or nicotine. There\u2019s a strong geneticcomponent to how obedient or rebellious you are when facingauthority, how vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, howproactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how captivated or boredyou feel during sensory experiences like attending a concert. As RobertPlomin, a behavioral geneticist at King\u2019s College in London, told me,\u201cIt is now at the point where we have stopped testing to see if traitshave a genetic component because we literally can\u2019t find a single onethat isn\u2019t influenced by our genes.\u201dBundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predisposeyou to a particular personality. Your personality is the set ofcharacteristics that is consistent from situation to situation. The mostproven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the \u201cBigFive,\u201d which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.", "1. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one endto cautious and consistent on the other.2. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing andspontaneous.3. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved(you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).4. Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging anddetached.5. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, andstable.All five characteristics have biological underpinnings. Extroversion,for instance, can be tracked from birth. If scientists play a loud noise inthe nursing ward, some babies turn toward it while others turn away.When the researchers tracked these children through life, they foundthat the babies who turned toward the noise were more likely to growup to be extroverts. Those who turned away were more likely tobecome introverts.People who are high in agreeableness are kind, considerate, andwarm. They also tend to have higher natural oxytocin levels, ahormone that plays an important role in social bonding, increasesfeelings of trust, and can act as a natural antidepressant. You can easilyimagine how someone with more oxytocin might be inclined to buildhabits like writing thank-you notes or organizing social events.As a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personalitytrait all people possess to various degrees. People who are high inneuroticism tend to be anxious and", "worry more than others. This traithas been linked to hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of thebrain responsible for noticing threats. In other words, people who aremore sensitive to negative cues in their environment are more likely toscore high in neuroticism.Our habits are not solely determined by our personalities, but thereis no doubt that our genes nudge us in a certain direction. Our deeplyrooted preferences make certain behaviors easier for some people thanfor others. You don\u2019t have to apologize for these differences or feelguilty about them, but you do have to work with them. A person whoscores lower on conscientiousness, for example, will be less likely to be", "orderly by nature and may need to rely more heavily on environmentdesign to stick with good habits. (As a reminder for the lessconscientious readers among us, environment design is a strategy wediscussed in Chapters 6 and 12.)The takeaway is that you should build habits that work for yourpersonality.* People can get ripped working out like a bodybuilder, butif you prefer rock climbing or cycling or rowing, then shape yourexercise habit around your interests. If your friend follows a low-carbdiet but you find that low-fat works for you, then more power to you. Ifyou want to read more, don\u2019t be embarrassed if you prefer steamyromance novels over nonfiction. Read whatever fascinates you.* Youdon\u2019t have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose thehabit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular.There is a version of every habit that can bring you joy andsatisfaction. Find it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going tostick. This is the core idea behind the 4th Law.Tailoring your habits to your personality is a good start, but this isnot the end of the story. Let\u2019s turn our attention to finding anddesigning situations where you\u2019re at a natural advantage.HOW TO", "FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVORLearning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical formaintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you canenjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy thethings that come easily to you. People who are talented in a particulararea tend to be more competent at that task and are then praised fordoing a good job. They stay energized because they are makingprogress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded withbetter pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes themhappier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work. It\u2019sa virtuous cycle.Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit andlife is a struggle.How do you pick the right habit? The first step is something wecovered in the 3rd Law: make it easy. In many cases, when people pickthe wrong habit, it simply means they picked a habit that was too", "difficult. When a habit is easy, you are more likely to be successful.When you are successful, you are more likely to feel satisfied. However,there is another level to consider. In the long-run, if you continue toadvance and improve, any area can become challenging. At somepoint, you need to make sure you\u2019re playing the right game for yourskillset. How do you figure that out?The most common approach is trial and error. Of course, there\u2019s aproblem with this strategy: life is short. You don\u2019t have time to tryevery career, date every eligible bachelor, or play every musicalinstrument. Thankfully, there is an effective way to manage thisconundrum, and it is known as the explore/exploit trade-off.In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period ofexploration. In relationships, it\u2019s called dating. In college, it\u2019s called theliberal arts. In business, it\u2019s called split testing. The goal is to try outmany possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the bestsolution you\u2019ve found\u2014but keep experimenting occasionally. Theproper balance depends on whether you\u2019re winning or losing. If youare currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currentlylosing, you continue to explore,", "explore, explore.In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategythat seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of thetime and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Googlefamously asks employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on theirofficial job and 20 percent on projects of their choice, which has led tothe creation of blockbuster products like AdWords and Gmail.The optimal approach also depends on how much time you have. Ifyou have a lot of time\u2014like someone at the beginning of their career\u2014it makes more sense to explore because once you find the right thing,you still have a good amount of time to exploit it. If you\u2019re pressed fortime\u2014say, as you come up on the deadline for a project\u2014you shouldimplement the best solution you\u2019ve found so far and get some results.As you explore different options, there are a series of questions youcan ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas thatwill be most satisfying to you:What feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark ofwhether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but", "whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than mostpeople. When are you enjoying yourself while other people arecomplaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others isthe work you were made to do.What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental stateyou enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that therest of the world fades away. This blend of happiness and peakperformance is what athletes and performers experience whenthey are \u201cin the zone.\u201d It is nearly impossible to experience a flowstate and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree.Where do I get greater returns than the average person?We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and abehavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is inour favor. When I started writing at jamesclear.com, my email listgrew very quickly. I wasn\u2019t quite sure what I was doing well, but Iknew that results seemed to be coming faster for me than forsome of my colleagues, which motivated me to keep writing.What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore whatyou have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignorewhat others expect of you.", "Look inside yourself and ask, \u201cWhatfeels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt likethe real me?\u201d No internal judgments or people-pleasing. Nosecond-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement andenjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you areheaded in the right direction.To be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael Phelps andHicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with a rare set of abilitiesthat are highly valued by society and to be placed in the idealenvironment for those abilities. We all have limited time on this planet,and the truly great among us are the ones who not only work hard butalso have the good fortune to be exposed to opportunities that favor us.But what if you don\u2019t want to leave it up to luck?If you can\u2019t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor,create one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says,\u201cEveryone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people,but I\u2019m hardly an artist. And I\u2019m not any funnier than the average", "standup comedian who never makes it big, but I\u2019m funnier than mostpeople. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It\u2019sthe combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And whenyou add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that fewcartoonists could hope to understand without living it.\u201dWhen you can\u2019t win by being better, you can win by being different.By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, whichmakes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a geneticadvantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A goodplayer works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A greatplayer creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids theirweaknesses.In college, I designed my own major, biomechanics, which was acombination of physics, chemistry, biology, and anatomy. I wasn\u2019tsmart enough to stand out among the top physics or biology majors, soI created my own game. And because it suited me\u2014I was only takingthe courses I was interested in\u2014studying felt like less of a chore. It wasalso easier to avoid the trap of comparing myself to everyone else. Afterall, nobody else was taking the same combination", "of classes, so whocould say if they were better or worse?Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the \u201caccident\u201d of badgenetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomesfor others to compete with you. Many bodybuilders are stronger thanthe average arm wrestler, but even a massive bodybuilder may lose atarm wrestling because the arm wrestling champ has very specificstrength. Even if you\u2019re not the most naturally gifted, you can often winby being the best in a very narrow category.Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can\u2019tcontrol whether you\u2019re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play agame where it\u2019s better to be hard or soft. If you can find a morefavorable environment, you can transform the situation from onewhere the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR GENESOur genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it.They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, weknow where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of", "opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. Thebetter we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.Biological differences matter. Even so, it\u2019s more productive to focuson whether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparingyourself to someone else. The fact that you have a natural limit to anyspecific ability has nothing to do with whether you are reaching theceiling of your capabilities. People get so caught up in the fact that theyhave limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close tothem.Furthermore, genes can\u2019t make you successful if you\u2019re not doingthe work. Yes, it\u2019s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has bettergenes, but if you haven\u2019t put in the same reps, it\u2019s impossible to say ifyou have been dealt a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work ashard as those you admire, don\u2019t explain away their success as luck.In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remainsatisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with yourpersonality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy.Chapter SummaryThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose theright field of competition.Pick the right habit and", "progress is easy.

Labor laws wereloose back then and the boy managed to land a position sellingguidebooks for $0.50 apiece.Within a year, he had transitioned to Disney\u2019s magic shop, where helearned tricks from the older employees. He experimented with jokesand tried out simple routines on visitors. Soon he discovered that whathe loved was not performing magic but performing in general. He sethis sights on becoming a comedian.Beginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little clubsaround Los Angeles. The crowds were small and his act was short. Hewas rarely on stage for more than five minutes. Most of the people inthe crowd were too busy drinking or talking with friends to payattention. One night, he literally delivered his stand-up routine to anempty club.It wasn\u2019t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was gettingbetter. His first routines would only last one or two minutes. By highschool, his material had expanded to include a five-minute act and, afew years later, a ten-minute show. At nineteen, he was performingweekly for twenty minutes at a time.", "He had to read three poemsduring the show just to make the routine long enough, but his skillscontinued to progress.He spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and practicing.He took a job as a television writer and, gradually, he was able to land"]}, "chapter 20": {"name": "The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work", "text": ["his own appearances on talk shows.

He toured sixty cities in sixty-three days. Then seventy-two citiesin eighty days. Then eighty-five cities in ninety days. He had 18,695people attend one show in Ohio. Another 45,000 tickets were sold forhis three-day show in New York. He catapulted to the top of his genreand became one of the most successful comedians of his time.His name is Steve Martin.Martin\u2019s story offers a fascinating perspective on what it takes tostick with habits for the long run. Comedy is not for the timid. It ishard to imagine a situation that would strike fear into the hearts ofmore people than performing alone on stage and failing to get a singlelaugh. And yet Steve Martin faced this fear every week for eighteenyears. In his words, \u201c10 years spent learning, 4 years spent refining,and 4 years as a wild success.\u201dWhy is it that some people, like Martin, stick with their habits\u2014whether practicing jokes or drawing cartoons or playing guitar\u2014whilemost of us struggle to stay motivated? How do we design", "habits thatpull us in rather than ones that fade away? Scientists have beenstudying this question for many years. While there is still much tolearn, one of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintainmotivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of \u201cjustmanageable difficulty.\u201dThe human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within anoptimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a seriousmatch against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It\u2019s tooeasy. You\u2019ll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professionaltennis player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quicklylose motivation because the match is too difficult.Now consider playing tennis against someone who is your equal. Asthe game progresses, you win a few points and you lose a few. You havea good chance of winning, but only if you really try. Your focusnarrows, distractions fade away, and you find yourself fully invested inthe task at hand. This is a challenge of just manageable difficulty and itis a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule.", "The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivationwhen working on tasks that are right on the edge of their currentabilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.THE GOLDILOCKS RULE FIGURE 15: Maximum motivation occurs when facing a challenge of justmanageable difficulty. In psychology research this is known as the Yerkes\u2013Dodson law, which describes the optimal level of arousal as the midpointbetween boredom and anxiety.Martin\u2019s comedy career is an excellent example of the GoldilocksRule in practice. Each year, he expanded his comedy routine\u2014but onlyby a minute or two. He was always adding new material, but he alsokept a few jokes that were guaranteed to get laughs. There were justenough victories to keep him motivated and just enough mistakes tokeep him working hard.When you\u2019re starting a new habit, it\u2019s important to keep thebehavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even whenconditions aren\u2019t perfect. This is an idea we covered in detail whilediscussing the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.", "Once a habit has been established, however, it\u2019s important tocontinue to advance in small ways. These little improvements and newchallenges keep you engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone justright, you can achieve a flow state.*A flow state is the experience of being \u201cin the zone\u201d and fullyimmersed in an activity. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling.They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4percent beyond your current ability. In real life it\u2019s typically notfeasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the coreidea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of justmanageable difficulty\u2014something on the perimeter of your ability\u2014seems crucial for maintaining motivation.Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularlysearch for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing tomake enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remainnovel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Withoutvariety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain onthe quest for self-improvement.HOW TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING ONYOUR GOALSAfter my baseball career ended, I was looking for a new sport. I joineda weightlifting team and one day an elite coach", "visited our gym. He hadworked with thousands of athletes during his long career, including afew Olympians. I introduced myself and we began talking about theprocess of improvement.\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?\u201dI asked. \u201cWhat do the really successful people do that most don\u2019t?\u201dHe mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent.But then he said something I wasn\u2019t expecting: \u201cAt some point it comesdown to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing thesame lifts over and over and over.\u201dHis answer surprised me because it\u2019s a different way of thinkingabout work ethic. People talk about getting \u201camped up\u201d to work ontheir goals. Whether it\u2019s business or sports or art, you hear people saythings like, \u201cIt all comes down to passion.\u201d Or, \u201cYou have to really want", "it.\u201d As a result, many of us get depressed when we lose focus ormotivation because we think that successful people have somebottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that reallysuccessful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. Thedifference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings ofboredom.Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, themore boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains havebeen made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade.Sometimes it happens even faster than that. All you have to do is hitthe gym a few days in a row or publish a couple of blog posts on timeand letting one day slip doesn\u2019t feel like much. Things are going well.It\u2019s easy to rationalize taking a day off because you\u2019re in a good place.The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We getbored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcomebecomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we startderailing our progress to seek novelty. Perhaps this is why we getcaught up in a never-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to thenext, one diet to the next, one business", "idea to the next. As soon as weexperience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a newstrategy\u2014even if the old one was still working. As Machiavelli noted,\u201cMen desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing wellwish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.\u201dPerhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products arethose that provide continuous forms of novelty. Video games providevisual novelty. Porn provides sexual novelty. Junk foods provideculinary novelty. Each of these experiences offer continual elements ofsurprise.In psychology, this is known as a variable reward.* Slot machinesare the most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpotevery now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace ofrewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine,enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.Variable rewards won\u2019t create a craving\u2014that is, you can\u2019t take areward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval,and hope it will change their mind\u2014but they are a powerful way toamplify the cravings we already experience because they reduceboredom.", "The sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success andfailure. Half of the time you get what you want. Half of the time youdon\u2019t. You need just enough \u201cwinning\u201d to experience satisfaction andjust enough \u201cwanting\u201d to experience desire. This is one of the benefitsof following the Goldilocks Rule. If you\u2019re already interested in a habit,working on challenges of just manageable difficulty is a good way tokeep things interesting.Of course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and youwouldn\u2019t want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search resultsome of the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If Uberonly picked up half of my trips, I doubt I\u2019d be using that service muchlonger. And if I flossed my teeth each night and only sometimes endedup with a clean mouth, I think I\u2019d skip it.Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. Atsome point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that wewould like to fulfill, but it doesn\u2019t matter what you are trying to becomebetter at, if you only", "do the work when it\u2019s convenient or exciting, thenyou\u2019ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep stickingto it, there will be days when you feel like quitting.

When you know thesimple movements so well that you can perform them withoutthinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details. In thisway, habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence.However, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, eachrepetition develops fluency, speed, and skill.

Establish a system for reflection and review.HOW TO REVIEW YOUR HABITS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTSIn 1986, the Los Angeles Lakers had one of the most talentedbasketball teams ever assembled, but they are rarely remembered thatway. The team started the 1985\u20131986 NBA season with an astounding29\u20135 record. \u201cThe pundits were saying that we might be the best teamin the history of basketball,\u201d head coach Pat Riley said after the season.Surprisingly, the Lakers stumbled in the 1986 playoffs and suffered aseason-ending defeat in the Western Conference Finals. The \u201cbestteam in the history of basketball\u201d didn\u2019t even play for the NBAchampionship.After that blow, Riley was tired of hearing about how much talenthis players had and about how much promise his team held. He didn\u2019twant to see flashes of brilliance followed by a gradual fade inperformance. He wanted the Lakers to play up to their potential, nightafter night. In the summer of 1986, he created a plan to do exactly that,a system that he called the Career Best Effort program or CBE.\u201cWhen players first join the Lakers,\u201d Riley explained, \u201cwe track theirbasketball statistics all the way back to high school.", "I call this TakingTheir Number. We look for an accurate gauge of what a player can do,then build him into our plan for the team, based on the notion that hewill maintain and then improve upon his averages.\u201dAfter determining a player\u2019s baseline level of performance, Rileyadded a key step. He asked each player to \u201cimprove their output by atleast 1 percent over the course of the season. If they succeeded, itwould be a CBE, or Career Best Effort.\u201d Similar to the British Cyclingteam that we discussed in Chapter 1, the Lakers sought peakperformance by getting slightly better each day.Riley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about pointsor statistics but about giving your \u201cbest effort spiritually and mentallyand physically.\u201d Players got credit for \u201callowing an opponent to runinto you when you know that a foul will be called against him, divingfor loose balls, going after rebounds whether you are likely to get them", "or not, helping a teammate when the player he\u2019s guarding has surgedpast him, and other \u2018unsung hero\u2019 deeds.\u201dAs an example, let\u2019s say that Magic Johnson\u2014the Lakers star playerat the time\u2014had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, and 5turnovers in a game. Magic also got credit for an \u201cunsung hero\u201d deedby diving after a loose ball (+1). Finally, he played a total of 33 minutesin this imaginary game.The positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to 34. Then, wesubtract the 5 turnovers (34\u20135) to get 29. Finally, we divide 29 by 33minutes played.29/33 = 0.879Magic\u2019s CBE number here would be 879. This number wascalculated for all of a player\u2019s games, and it was the average CBE that aplayer was asked to improve by 1 percent over the season. Rileycompared each player\u2019s current CBE to not only their pastperformances but also those of other players in the league. As Riley putit, \u201cWe rank team members alongside league opponents who play thesame position and have similar role definitions.\u201dSportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, \u201cRiley trumpeted the topperformers in the league in bold lettering on the blackboard each weekand measured them against the corresponding players on his ownroster.", "Solid, reliable players generally rated a score in the 600s, whileelite players scored at least 800. Magic Johnson, who submitted 138triple-doubles in his career, often scored over 1,000.\u201dThe Lakers also emphasized year-over-year progress by makinghistorical comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, \u201cWe stacked the monthof November 1986, next to November 1985, and showed the playerswhether they were doing better or worse than at the same point lastseason. Then we showed them how their performance figures forDecember 1986, stacked up against November\u2019s.\u201dThe Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight months later, theywere NBA champions. The following year, Pat Riley led his team toanother title as the Lakers became the first team in twenty years to winback-to-back NBA championships. Afterward, he said, \u201cSustaining aneffort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The way to besuccessful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the sameway every time.\u201d", "The CBE program is a prime example of the power of reflection andreview. The Lakers were already talented. CBE helped them get themost out of what they had, and made sure their habits improved ratherthan declined.Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of allhabits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps youconsider possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we canmake excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have noprocess for determining whether we are performing better or worsecompared to yesterday.Top performers in all fields engage in various types of reflection andreview, and the process doesn\u2019t have to be complex. Kenyan runnerEliud Kipchoge is one of the greatest marathoners of all time and anOlympic gold medalist. He still takes notes after every practice inwhich he reviews his training for the day and searches for areas thatcan be improved. Similarly, gold medal swimmer Katie Ledeckyrecords her wellness on a scale of 1 to 10 and includes notes on hernutrition and how well she slept. She also records the times posted byother swimmers. At the end of each week, her coach goes over hernotes and adds his thoughts.It\u2019s not just athletes, either. When comedian Chris Rock is preparingfresh material,", "he will first appear at small nightclubs dozens of timesand test hundreds of jokes. He brings a notepad on stage and recordswhich bits go over well and where he needs to make adjustments. Thefew killer lines that survive will form the backbone of his new show.I know of executives and investors who keep a \u201cdecision journal\u201d inwhich they record the major decisions they make each week, why theymade them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review theirchoices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correctand where they went wrong.*Improvement is not just about learning habits, it\u2019s also about fine-tuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your timeon the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary\u2014like Pat Riley adjusting the effort of his players on a nightly basis. Youdon\u2019t want to keep practicing a habit if it becomes ineffective.Personally, I employ two primary modes of reflection and review.Each December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the", "previous year. I tally my habits for the year by counting up how manyarticles I published, how many workouts I put in, how many newplaces I visited, and more.* Then, I reflect on my progress (or lackthereof) by answering three questions:1. What went well this year?2. What didn\u2019t go so well this year?3. What did I learn?Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an IntegrityReport. Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Reporthelps me realize where I went wrong and motivates me to get back oncourse. I use it as a time to revisit my core values and consider whetherI have been living in accordance with them. This is when I reflect onmy identity and how I can work toward being the type of person I wishto become.*My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?2. How am I living and working with integrity right now?3. How can I set a higher standard in the future?These two reports don\u2019t take very long\u2014just a few hours per year\u2014but they are crucial periods of refinement. They prevent the gradualslide that happens when I don\u2019t pay close attention. They", "provide anannual reminder to revisit my desired identity and consider how myhabits are helping me become the type of person I wish to be. Theyindicate when I should upgrade my habits and take on new challengesand when I should dial my efforts back and focus on the fundamentals.Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits arepowerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much aboutevery daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inchaway. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the biggerpicture. There is too much feedback. Conversely, never reviewing yourhabits is like never looking in the mirror. You aren\u2019t aware of easilyfixable flaws\u2014a spot on your shirt, a bit of food in your teeth. There is", "too little feedback. Periodic reflection and review is like viewingyourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can see theimportant changes you should make without losing sight of the biggerpicture. You want to view the entire mountain range, not obsess overeach peak and valley.Finally, reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one ofthe most important aspects of behavior change: identity.HOW TO BREAK THE BELIEFS THAT HOLD YOU BACKIn the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence ofyour desired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however,those same beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth.When working against you, your identity creates a kind of \u201cpride\u201d thatencourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from trulygrowing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building habits.The more sacred an idea is to us\u2014that is, the more deeply it is tiedto our identity\u2014the more strongly we will defend it against criticism.You see this in every industry. The schoolteacher who ignoresinnovative teaching methods and sticks with her tried-and-true lessonplans. The veteran manager who is committed to doing things \u201chisway.\u201d The surgeon who dismisses the ideas of her younger colleagues.The band", "who produces a mind-blowing first album and then getsstuck in a rut. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomesto grow beyond it.One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity anoverwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor PaulGraham, \u201ckeep your identity small.\u201d The more you let a single beliefdefine you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challengesyou. If you tie everything up in being the point guard or the partner atthe firm or whatever else, then the loss of that facet of your life willwreck you. If you\u2019re a vegan and then develop a health condition thatforces you to change your diet, you\u2019ll have an identity crisis on yourhands. When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle.Lose that one thing and you lose yourself.For most of my young life, being an athlete was a major part of myidentity. After my baseball career ended, I struggled to find myself.", "When you spend your whole life defining yourself in one way and thatdisappears, who are you now?Military veterans and former entrepreneurs report similar feelings.If your identity is wrapped up in a belief like \u201cI\u2019m a great soldier,\u201d whathappens when your period of service ends? For many business owners,their identity is something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m the CEO\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m thefounder.\u201d If you have spent every waking moment working on yourbusiness, how will you feel after you sell the company?The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourselfsuch that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even ifyour particular role changes.\u201cI\u2019m an athlete\u201d becomes \u201cI\u2019m the type of person who is mentallytough and loves a physical challenge.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a great soldier\u201d transforms into \u201cI\u2019m the type of person whois disciplined, reliable, and great on a team.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the CEO\u201d translates to \u201cI\u2019m the type of person who buildsand creates things.\u201dWhen chosen effectively, an identity can be flexible rather thanbrittle. Like water flowing around an obstacle, your identity works withthe changing circumstances rather than against them.The following quote from the Tao Te Ching encapsulates the ideasperfectly:Men are born soft and supple;dead, they are stiff and hard.Plants are born", "tender and pliant;dead, they are brittle and dry.Thus whoever is stiff and inflexibleis a disciple of death.Whoever is soft and yieldingis a disciple of life.The hard and stiff will be broken.", "The soft and supple will prevail.\u2014LAO TZUHabits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they canlock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting\u2014even whenthe world is shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life isconstantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if yourold habits and beliefs are still serving you.A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is theantidote.Chapter SummaryThe upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking.The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.Habits + Deliberate Practice = MasteryReflection and review is a process that allows you to remainconscious of your performance over time.The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to growbeyond it.", "TConclusionThe Secret to Results That LastHERE IS AN ancient Greek parable known as the Sorites Paradox,*which talks about the effect one small action can have whenrepeated enough times. One formulation of the paradox goes asfollows: Can one coin make a person rich? If you give a person a pile often coins, you wouldn\u2019t claim that he or she is rich. But what if you addanother? And another? And another? At some point, you will have toadmit that no one can be rich unless one coin can make him or her so.We can say the same about atomic habits. Can one tiny changetransform your life? It\u2019s unlikely you would say so. But what if youmade another? And another? And another? At some point, you willhave to admit that your life was transformed by one small change.The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement,but a thousand of them. It\u2019s a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, eachone a fundamental unit of the overall system.In the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaninglessbecause they get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as onecoin won\u2019t make you rich, one positive change like meditating for oneminute or", "reading one page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeabledifference.Gradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top ofone another, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is likeadding a grain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tiltingthings in your favor. Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tippingpoint. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight ofthe system is working for you rather than against you.Over the course of this book, we\u2019ve looked at dozens of stories abouttop performers.
