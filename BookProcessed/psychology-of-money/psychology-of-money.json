{"chapter 1": {"name": "Introduction", "text": ["A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a \ufb01nancial disaster. The opposite is alsotrue. Ordinary folks with no \ufb01nancial education can be wealthy if they have a handful ofbehavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence. My favorite Wikipedia entry begins: \u201cRonald James Read was an American philanthropist,investor, janitor, and gas station attendant.\u201dRonald Read was born in rural Vermont. He was the \ufb01rst person in his family to graduatehigh school, made all the more impressive by the fact that he hitchhiked to campus eachday.For those who knew Ronald Read, there wasn\u2019t much else worth mentioning. His life wasabout as low key as they come.Read \ufb01xed cars at a gas station for 25 years and swept \ufb02oors at JCPenney for 17 years. Hebought a two-bedroom house for $12,000 at age 38 and lived there for the rest of his life.He was widowed at age 50 and never remarried. A friend recalled that his main hobby waschopping \ufb01rewood.Read died in 2014, age 92. Which is when the humble rural janitor made internationalheadlines.2,813,503 Americans died in 2014. Fewer than 4,000 of them had a net worth of over $8million when they passed away. Ronald Read was", "one of them.In his will the former janitor left $2 million to his stepkids and more than $6 million to hislocal hospital and library.Those who knew Read were ba\ufb04ed. Where did he get all that money?It turned out there was no secret. There was no lottery win and no inheritance. Read savedwhat little he could and invested it in blue chip stocks. Then he waited, for decades on end,as tiny savings compounded into more than $8 million.That\u2019s it. From janitor to philanthropist.A few months before Ronald Read died, another man named Richard was in the news.Richard Fuscone was everything Ronald Read was not. A Harvard-educated Merrill Lynchexecutive with an MBA, Fuscone had such a successful career in \ufb01nance that he retired inhis 40s to become a philanthropist. Former Merrill CEO David Komansky praised Fuscone\u2019s\u201cbusiness savvy, leadership skills, sound judgment and personal integrity.\u201d\u00b9 Crain\u2019sbusiness magazine once included him in a \u201c40 under 40\u201d list of successful businesspeople.\u00b2But then\u2014like the gold-coin-skipping tech executive\u2014everything fell apart.In the mid-2000s Fuscone borrowed heavily to expand an 18,000-square foot home inGreenwich, Connecticut that had 11 bathrooms, two elevators, two pools, seven garages,and cost more than $90,000 a month to maintain.Then the 2008 \ufb01nancial crisis hit.The crisis", "hurt virtually everyone\u2019s \ufb01nances. It apparently turned Fuscone\u2019s into dust. Highdebt and illiquid assets left him bankrupt. \u201cI currently have no income,\u201d he allegedly told a", "bankruptcy judge in 2008.First his Palm Beach house was foreclosed.In 2014 it was the Greenwich mansion\u2019s turn.Five months before Ronald Read left his fortune to charity, Richard Fuscone\u2019s home\u2014whereguests recalled the \u201cthrill of dining and dancing atop a see-through covering on the home\u2019sindoor swimming pool\u201d\u2014was sold in a foreclosure auction for 75% less than an insurancecompany \ufb01gured it was worth.\u00b3Ronald Read was patient; Richard Fuscone was greedy. That\u2019s all it took to eclipse themassive education and experience gap between the two.The lesson here is not to be more like Ronald and less like Richard\u2014though that\u2019s not badadvice.The fascinating thing about these stories is how unique they are to \ufb01nance.In what other industry does someone with no college degree, no training, no background,no formal experience, and no connections massively outperform someone with the besteducation, the best training, and the best connections?I struggle to think of any.It is impossible to think of a story about Ronald Read performing a heart transplant betterthan a Harvard-trained surgeon. Or designing a skyscraper superior to the best-trainedarchitects. There will never be a story of a janitor outperforming the world\u2019s top nuclearengineers.But these stories do happen in investing.The fact that Ronald Read can coexist with Richard Fuscone", "has two explanations. One,\ufb01nancial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of intelligence and e\ufb00ort. That\u2019s true tosome extent, and this book will discuss it in further detail. Or, two (and I think morecommon), that \ufb01nancial success is not a hard science. It\u2019s a soft skill, where how youbehave is more important than what you know.I call this soft skill the psychology of money. The aim of this book is to use short stories toconvince you that soft skills are more important than the technical side of money. I\u2019ll do thisin a way that will help everyone\u2014from Read to Fuscone and everyone in between\u2014makebetter \ufb01nancial decisions.These soft skills are, I\u2019ve come to realize, greatly underappreciated.Finance is overwhelmingly taught as a math-based \ufb01eld, where you put data into a formulaand the formula tells you what to do, and it\u2019s assumed that you\u2019ll just go do it.This is true in personal \ufb01nance, where you\u2019re told to have a six-month emergency fund andsave 10% of your salary.It\u2019s true in investing, where we know the exact historical correlations between interest ratesand valuations.And it\u2019s true in corporate \ufb01nance, where CFOs can measure the precise cost of capital.", "It\u2019s not that any of these things are bad or wrong. It\u2019s that knowing what to do tells younothing about what happens in your head when you try to do it. Two topics impact everyone, whether you are interested in them or not: health and money.The health care industry is a triumph of modern science, with rising life expectancy acrossthe world. Scienti\ufb01c discoveries have replaced doctors\u2019 old ideas about how the humanbody works, and virtually everyone is healthier because of it.The money industry\u2014investing, personal \ufb01nance, business planning\u2014is another story.Finance has scooped up the smartest minds coming from top universities over the last twodecades. Financial Engineering was the most popular major in Princeton\u2019s School ofEngineering a decade ago. Is there any evidence it has made us better investors?I have seen none.Through collective trial and error over the years we learned how to become better farmers,skilled plumbers, and advanced chemists. But has trial and error taught us to becomebetter with our personal \ufb01nances? Are we less likely to bury ourselves in debt? More likelyto save for a rainy day? Prepare for retirement? Have realistic views about what moneydoes, and doesn\u2019t do, to our happiness?I\u2019ve seen no compelling evidence.Most of the reason why,", "I believe, is that we think about and are taught about money inways that are too much like physics (with rules and laws) and not enough like psychology(with emotions and nuance).And that, to me, is as fascinating as it is important.Money is everywhere, it a\ufb00ects all of us, and confuses most of us. Everyone thinks about it alittle di\ufb00erently. It o\ufb00ers lessons on things that apply to many areas of life, like risk,con\ufb01dence, and happiness. Few topics o\ufb00er a more powerful magnifying glass that helpsexplain why people behave the way they do than money. It is one of the greatest shows onEarth.My own appreciation for the psychology of money is shaped by more than a decade ofwriting on the topic. I began writing about \ufb01nance in early 2008. It was the dawn of a\ufb01nancial crisis and the worst recession in 80 years.To write about what was happening, I wanted to \ufb01gure out what was happening. But the\ufb01rst thing I learned after the \ufb01nancial crisis was that no one could accurately explain whathappened, or why it happened, let alone what should be done about it. For every goodexplanation there was an equally convincing rebuttal.Engineers can determine the cause of a bridge", "collapse because there\u2019s agreement that if acertain amount of force is applied to a certain area, that area will break. Physics isn\u2019tcontroversial. It\u2019s guided by laws. Finance is di\ufb00erent. It\u2019s guided by people\u2019s behaviors.And how I behave might make sense to me but look crazy to you.The more I studied and wrote about the \ufb01nancial crisis, the more I realized that you couldunderstand it better through the lenses of psychology and history, not \ufb01nance.", "To grasp why people bury themselves in debt you don\u2019t need to study interest rates; youneed to study the history of greed, insecurity, and optimism. To get why investors sell out atthe bottom of a bear market you don\u2019t need to study the math of expected future returns;you need to think about the agony of looking at your family and wondering if yourinvestments are imperiling their future.I love Voltaire\u2019s observation that \u201cHistory never repeats itself; man always does.\u201d It appliesso well to how we behave with money.In 2018, I wrote a report outlining 20 of the most important \ufb02aws, biases, and causes ofbad behavior I\u2019ve seen a\ufb00ect people when dealing with money. It was called The Psychologyof Money, and over one million people have read it. This book is a deeper dive into thetopic. Some short passages from the report appear unaltered in this book.What you\u2019re holding is 20 chapters, each describing what I consider to be the mostimportant and often counterintuitive features of the psychology of money. The chaptersrevolve around a common theme, but exist on their own and can be read independently.It\u2019s not a long book. You\u2019re welcome.

So all of us\u2014you, me, everyone\u2014go through life anchored to a set of views about how moneyworks that vary wildly from person to person. What seemscrazy to you might make sense to me.The person who grew up in poverty thinks about risk andreward in ways the child of a wealthy banker cannot fathom ifhe tried.The person who grew up when in\ufb02ation was high experiencedsomething the person who grew up with stable prices neverhad to.The stock broker who lost everything during the GreatDepression experienced something the tech worker basking inthe glory of the late 1990s can\u2019t imagine.The Australian who hasn\u2019t seen a recession", "in 30 years hasexperienced something no American ever has.On and on.

It\u2019s because we\u2019ve had di\ufb00erent livesshaped by di\ufb00erent and equally persuasive experiences.Your personal experiences with money make up maybe0.00000001% of what\u2019s happened in the world, but maybe80% of how you think the world works. So equally smartpeople can disagree about how and why recessions happen,how you should invest your money, what you should prioritize,how much risk you should take, and so on.In his book on 1930s America, Frederick Lewis Allen wrote thatthe Great Depression \u201cmarked millions of Americans\u2014inwardly\u2014for the rest of their lives.\u201d But there was a range ofexperiences. Twenty-\ufb01ve years later, as he was running forpresident, John F. Kennedy was asked by a reporter what heremembered from the Depression. He remarked: I have no \ufb01rst-hand knowledge of the Depression. My familyhad one of the great fortunes of the world and it was worthmore than ever then.

That was the other mostwidespread emotional experience of the previous generation,", "and something his primary opponent, Hubert Humphrey, didn\u2019thave.The challenge for us is that no amount of studying or open-mindedness can genuinely recreate the power of fear anduncertainty.I can read about what it was like to lose everything during theGreat Depression. But I don\u2019t have the emotional scars of thosewho actually experienced it. And the person who lived throughit can\u2019t fathom why someone like me could come across ascomplacent about things like owning stocks. We see the worldthrough a di\ufb00erent lens.Spreadsheets can model the historic frequency of big stockmarket declines. But they can\u2019t model the feeling of cominghome, looking at your kids, and wondering if you\u2019ve made amistake that will impact their lives. Studying history makes youfeel like you understand something. But until you\u2019ve livedthrough it and personally felt its consequences, you may notunderstand it enough to change your behavior.We all think we know how the world works. But we\u2019ve all onlyexperienced a tiny sliver of it.As investor Michael Batnick says, \u201csome lessons have to beexperienced before they can be understood.\u201d We are allvictims, in di\ufb00erent ways, to that truth. In 2006 economists Ulrike Malmendier and Stefan Nagel fromthe National Bureau of Economic Research dug through 50years of the Survey of", "Consumer Finances\u2014a detailed look atwhat Americans do with their money.\u2074In theory people should make investment decisions based ontheir goals and the characteristics of the investment options", "available to them at the time.But that\u2019s not what people do.The economists found that people\u2019s lifetime investmentdecisions are heavily anchored to the experiences thoseinvestors had in their own generation\u2014especially experiencesearly in their adult life.If you grew up when in\ufb02ation was high, you invested less ofyour money in bonds later in life compared to those who grewup when in\ufb02ation was low. If you happened to grow up whenthe stock market was strong, you invested more of your moneyin stocks later in life compared to those who grew up whenstocks were weak.The economists wrote: \u201cOur \ufb01ndings suggest that individualinvestors\u2019 willingness to bear risk depends on personal history.\u201dNot intelligence, or education, or sophistication. Just the dumbluck of when and where you were born.The Financial Times interviewed Bill Gross, the famed bondmanager, in 2019. \u201cGross admits that he would probably notbe where he is today if he had been born a decade earlier orlater,\u201d the piece said. Gross\u2019s career coincided almost perfectlywith a generational collapse in interest rates that gave bondprices a tailwind. That kind of thing doesn\u2019t just a\ufb00ect theopportunities you come across; it a\ufb00ects what you think aboutthose opportunities when they\u2019re presented to you. To Gross,bonds were wealth-generating machines. To his father\u2019sgeneration,", "who grew up with and endured higher in\ufb02ation,they might be seen as wealth incinerators.The di\ufb00erences in how people have experienced money are notsmall, even among those you might think are pretty similar.", "Take stocks. If you were born in 1970, the S&P 500 increasedalmost 10-fold, adjusted for in\ufb02ation, during your teens and20s. That\u2019s an amazing return. If you were born in 1950, themarket went literally nowhere in your teens and 20s adjustedfor in\ufb02ation. Two groups of people, separated by chance oftheir birth year, go through life with a completely di\ufb00erentview on how the stock market works: Or in\ufb02ation.

America\u2019s nationwide unemployment in November 2009 wasaround 10%. But the unemployment rate for African Americanmales age 16 to 19 without a high school diploma was 49%.For Caucasian females over age 45 with a college degree, itwas 4%.Local stock markets in Germany and Japan were wiped outduring World War II. Entire regions were bombed out. At theend of the war German farms only produced enough food toprovide the country\u2019s citizens with 1,000 calories a day.Compare that to the U.S., where the stock market more than", "doubled from 1941 through the end of 1945, and the economywas the strongest it had been in almost two decades.No one should expect members of these groups to go throughthe rest of their lives thinking the same thing about in\ufb02ation.Or the stock market. Or unemployment. Or money in general.No one should expect them to respond to \ufb01nancial informationthe same way. No one should assume they are in\ufb02uenced bythe same incentives.No one should expect them to trust the same sources of advice.No one should expect them to agree on what matters, what\u2019sworth it, what\u2019s likely to happen next, and what the best pathforward is.Their view of money was formed in di\ufb00erent worlds. And whenthat\u2019s the case, a view about money that one group of peoplethinks is outrageous can make perfect sense to another.A few years ago, The New York Times did a story on the workingconditions of Foxconn, the massive Taiwanese electronicsmanufacturer. The conditions are often atrocious. Readers wererightly upset. But a fascinating response to the story camefrom the nephew of a Chinese worker, who wrote in thecomment section: My aunt worked several years in what Americans call \u201csweatshops.\u201d It was hard work. Long hours, \u201csmall\u201d wage, \u201cpoor\u201dworking conditions. Do you", "know what my aunt did before sheworked in one of these factories? She was a prostitute.The idea of working in a \u201csweat shop\u201d compared to that oldlifestyle is an improvement, in my opinion. I know that my auntwould rather be \u201cexploited\u201d by an evil capitalist boss for a", "couple of dollars than have her body be exploited by severalmen for pennies.That is why I am upset by many Americans\u2019 thinking. We donot have the same opportunities as the West. Ourgovernmental infrastructure is di\ufb00erent. The country isdi\ufb00erent. Yes, factory is hard labor. Could it be better? Yes, butonly when you compare such to American jobs. I don\u2019t know what to make of this. Part of me wants to argue,\ufb01ercely. Part of me wants to understand. But mostly it\u2019s anexample of how di\ufb00erent experiences can lead to vastlydi\ufb00erent views within topics that one side intuitively thinksshould be black and white.Every decision people make with money is justi\ufb01ed by takingthe information they have at the moment and plugging it intotheir unique mental model of how the world works.Those people can be misinformed. They can have incompleteinformation. They can be bad at math. They can be persuadedby rotten marketing. They can have no idea what they\u2019re doing.They can misjudge the consequences of their actions. Oh, canthey ever.But every \ufb01nancial decision a person makes, makes sense tothem in that moment and checks the boxes they need tocheck. They tell themselves a story about what they\u2019re doingand why they\u2019re doing it, and that story", "has been shaped bytheir own unique experiences.Take a simple example: lottery tickets.Americans spend more on them than movies, video games,music, sporting events, and books combined.And who buys them? Mostly poor people.", "The lowest-income households in the U.S. on average spend$412 a year on lotto tickets, four times the amount of those inthe highest income groups. Forty percent of Americans cannotcome up with $400 in an emergency. Which is to say: Thosebuying $400 in lottery tickets are by and large the same peoplewho say they couldn\u2019t come up with $400 in an emergency.They are blowing their safety nets on something with a one-in-millions chance of hitting it big.That seems crazy to me. It probably seems crazy to you, too.But I\u2019m not in the lowest income group. You\u2019re likely not, either.So it\u2019s hard for many of us to intuitively grasp the subconsciousreasoning of low-income lottery ticket buyers.But strain a little, and you can imagine it going something likethis: We live paycheck-to-paycheck and saving seems out of reach.Our prospects for much higher wages seem out of reach. Wecan\u2019t a\ufb00ord nice vacations, new cars, health insurance, orhomes in safe neighborhoods. We can\u2019t put our kids throughcollege without crippling debt. Much of the stu\ufb00 you peoplewho read \ufb01nance books either have now, or have a goodchance of getting, we don\u2019t. Buying a lottery ticket is the onlytime in our lives we can hold a tangible dream", "of getting thegood stu\ufb00 that you already have and take for granted. We arepaying for a dream, and you may not understand that becauseyou are already living a dream. That\u2019s why we buy more ticketsthan you do. You don\u2019t have to agree with this reasoning. Buying lottotickets when you\u2019re broke is still a bad idea. But I can kind ofunderstand why lotto ticket sales persist.", "And that idea\u2014\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing seems crazy but I kind ofunderstand why you\u2019re doing it.\u201d\u2014uncovers the root of many ofour \ufb01nancial decisions.Few people make \ufb01nancial decisions purely with aspreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in acompany meeting. Places where personal history, your ownunique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and oddincentives are scrambled together into a narrative that worksfor you. Another important point that helps explain why moneydecisions are so di\ufb03cult, and why there is so muchmisbehavior, is to recognize how new this topic is.Money has been around a long time. King Alyattes of Lydia,now part of Turkey, is thought to have created the \ufb01rst o\ufb03cialcurrency in 600 BC. But the modern foundation of moneydecisions\u2014saving and investing\u2014is based around conceptsthat are practically infants.Take retirement. At the end of 2018 there was $27 trillion inU.S. retirement accounts, making it the main driver of thecommon investor\u2019s saving and investing decisions.\u2075But the entire concept of being entitled to retirement is, atmost, two generations old.Before World War II most Americans worked until they died.That was the expectation and the reality. The labor forceparticipation rate of men age 65 and over was above 50% untilthe 1940s:", "Social Security aimed to change this. But its initial bene\ufb01tswere nothing close to a proper pension. When Ida May Fullercashed the \ufb01rst Social Security check in 1940, it was for$22.54, or $416 adjusted for in\ufb02ation. It was not until the1980s that the average Social Security check for retireesexceeded $1,000 a month adjusted for in\ufb02ation. More than aquarter of Americans over age 65 were classi\ufb01ed by the CensusBureau as living in poverty until the late 1960s.There is a widespread belief along the lines of, \u201ceveryone usedto have a private pension.\u201d But this is wildly exaggerated. TheEmployee Bene\ufb01t Research Institute explains: \u201cOnly a quarterof those age 65 or older had pension income in 1975.\u201d Amongthat lucky minority, only 15% of household income came froma pension.", "The New York Times wrote in 1955 about the growing desire,but continued inability, to retire: \u201cTo rephrase an old saying:everyone talks about retirement, but apparently very few doanything about it.\u201d\u2076It was not until the 1980s that the idea that everyone deserves,and should have, a digni\ufb01ed retirement took hold. And the wayto get that digni\ufb01ed retirement ever since has been anexpectation that everyone will save and invest their ownmoney.Let me reiterate how new this idea is: The 401(k)\u2014thebackbone savings vehicle of American retirement\u2014did notexist until 1978. The Roth IRA was not born until 1998. If itwere a person it would be barely old enough to drink.It should surprise no one that many of us are bad at saving andinvesting for retirement. We\u2019re not crazy. We\u2019re all justnewbies.Same goes for college. The share of Americans over age 25with a bachelor\u2019s degree has gone from less than 1 in 20 in1940 to 1 in 4 by 2015.\u2077 The average college tuition over thattime rose more than fourfold adjusted for in\ufb02ation.\u2078 Somethingso big and so important hitting society so fast explains why, forexample, so many people have made poor decisions withstudent loans over the last 20 years. There is not decades ofaccumulated experience to", "even attempt to learn from. We\u2019rewinging it.Same for index funds, which are less than 50 years old.

Bill and Paul could toyaway with the thing at their leisure, letting their creativityrun wild\u2014after school, late into the night, on weekends.They quickly became computing experts.During one of their late-night sessions, Allen recalled Gatesshowing him a Fortune magazine and saying, \u201cWhat do youthink it\u2019s like to run a Fortune 500 company?\u201d Allen said hehad no idea. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have our own computer companysomeday,\u201d Gates said. Microsoft is now worth more than atrillion dollars.A little quick math.In 1968 there were roughly 303 million high-school-agepeople in the world, according to the UN.About 18 million of them lived in the United States.About 270,000 of them lived in Washington state.A little over 100,000 of them lived in the Seattle area.And only about 300 of them attended Lakeside School.Start with 303 million, end with 300.One in a million high-school-age students attended the highschool that had the combination of cash and foresight tobuy a computer. Bill Gates happened to be one of them.", "Gates is not shy about what this meant. \u201cIf there had beenno Lakeside, there would have been no Microsoft,\u201d he toldthe school\u2019s graduating class in 2005.Gates is staggeringly smart, even more hardworking, and asa teenager had a vision for computers that even mostseasoned computer executives couldn\u2019t grasp. He also had aone in a million head start by going to school at Lakeside.Now let me tell you about Gates\u2019 friend Kent Evans. Heexperienced an equally powerful dose of luck\u2019s close sibling,risk.Bill Gates and Paul Allen became household names thanksto Microsoft\u2019s success. But back at Lakeside there was athird member of this gang of high-school computerprodigies.Kent Evans and Bill Gates became best friends in eighthgrade. Evans was, by Gates\u2019 own account, the best studentin the class.The two talked \u201con the phone ridiculous amounts,\u201d Gatesrecalls in the documentary Inside Bill\u2019s Brain. \u201cI still knowKent\u2019s phone number,\u201d he says. \u201c525-7851.\u201dEvans was as skilled with computers as Gates and Allen.Lakeside once struggled to manually put together theschool\u2019s class schedule\u2014a maze of complexity to gethundreds of students the classes they need at times thatdon\u2019t con\ufb02ict with other courses. The school tasked Bill andKent\u2014children, by any measure\u2014to build a computerprogram to solve the problem. It worked.And unlike", "Paul Allen, Kent shared Bill\u2019s business mind andendless ambition. \u201cKent always had the big briefcase, like alawyer\u2019s briefcase,\u201d Gates recalls. \u201cWe were always", "scheming about what we\u2019d be doing \ufb01ve or six years in thefuture. Should we go be CEOs? What kind of impact couldyou have? Should we go be generals? Should we go beambassadors?\u201d Whatever it was, Bill and Kent knew they\u2019ddo it together.After reminiscing on his friendship with Kent, Gates trails o\ufb00.\u201cWe would have kept working together. I\u2019m sure we wouldhave gone to college together.\u201d Kent could have been afounding partner of Microsoft with Gates and Allen.But it would never happen. Kent died in a mountaineeringaccident before he graduated high school.Every year there are around three dozen mountaineeringdeaths in the United States.\u2079 The odds of being killed on amountain in high school are roughly one in a million.Bill Gates experienced one in a million luck by ending up atLakeside. Kent Evans experienced one in a million risk bynever getting to \ufb01nish what he and Gates set out to achieve.The same force, the same magnitude, working in oppositedirections.Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in lifeis guided by forces other than individual e\ufb00ort. They are sosimilar that you can\u2019t believe in one without equallyrespecting the other. They both happen because the world istoo complex to allow 100% of your", "actions to dictate 100%of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: Youare one person in a game with seven billion other peopleand in\ufb01nite moving parts. The accidental impact of actionsoutside of your control can be more consequential than theones you consciously take.", "But both are so hard to measure, and hard to accept, thatthey too often go overlooked. For every Bill Gates there is aKent Evans who was just as skilled and driven but ended upon the other side of life roulette.If you give luck and risk their proper respect, you realize thatwhen judging people\u2019s \ufb01nancial success\u2014both your ownand others\u2019\u2014it\u2019s never as good or as bad as it seems. Years ago I asked economist Robert Shiller, who won theNobel Prize in economics, \u201cWhat do you want to know aboutinvesting that we can\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cThe exact role of luck in successful outcomes,\u201d heanswered.I love that response, because no one actually thinks luckdoesn\u2019t play a role in \ufb01nancial success. But since it\u2019s hard toquantify luck and rude to suggest people\u2019s success is owedto it, the default stance is often to implicitly ignore luck as afactor of success.If I say, \u201cThere are a billion investors in the world. By sheerchance, would you expect 10 of them to become billionairespredominantly o\ufb00 luck?\u201d You would reply, \u201cOf course.\u201d Butthen if I ask you to name those investors\u2014to their face\u2014youwill likely back down.When judging others, attributing success to luck makes youlook jealous and mean, even if we know it", "exists. And whenjudging yourself, attributing success to luck can be toodemoralizing to accept.", "Economist Bhashkar Mazumder has shown that incomesamong brothers are more correlated than height or weight.If you are rich and tall, your brother is more likely to also berich than he is tall. I think most of us intuitively know this istrue\u2014the quality of your education and the doors that openfor you are heavily linked to your parents\u2019 socioeconomicstatus. But \ufb01nd me two rich brothers and I\u2019ll show you twomen who do not think this study\u2019s \ufb01ndings apply to them.Failure\u2014which can be anything from bankruptcy to notmeeting a personal goal\u2014is equally abused.Did failed businesses not try hard enough? Were badinvestments not thought through well enough? Are waywardcareers due to laziness? Sometimes, yes. Of course.But how much? It\u2019s so hard to know. Everything worthpursuing has less than 100% odds of succeeding, and risk isjust what happens when you end up on the unfortunate sideof that equation. Just as with luck, the story gets too hard,too messy, too complex if we try to pick apart how much ofan outcome was a conscious decision versus a risk.Say I buy a stock, and \ufb01ve years later it\u2019s gone nowhere. It\u2019spossible that I made a bad decision by buying it in the \ufb01rstplace. It\u2019s also possible", "that I made a good decision that hadan 80% chance of making money, and I just happened toend up on the side of the unfortunate 20%. How do I knowwhich is which? Did I make a mistake, or did I justexperience the reality of risk?It\u2019s possible to statistically measure whether some decisionswere wise. But in the real world, day to day, we simply don\u2019t.It\u2019s too hard. We prefer simple stories, which are easy butoften devilishly misleading.", "After spending years around investors and business leadersI\u2019ve come to realize that someone else\u2019s failure is usuallyattributed to bad decisions, while your own failures areusually chalked up to the dark side of risk. When judgingyour failures I\u2019m likely to prefer a clean and simple story ofcause and e\ufb00ect, because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going oninside your head. \u201cYou had a bad outcome so it must havebeen caused by a bad decision\u201d is the story that makes themost sense to me. But when judging myself I can make up awild narrative justifying my past decisions and attributingbad outcomes to risk.The cover of Forbes magazine does not celebrate poorinvestors who made good decisions but happened toexperience the unfortunate side of risk. But it almostcertainly celebrates rich investors who made OK or evenreckless decisions and happened to get lucky. Both \ufb02ippedthe same coin that happened to land on a di\ufb00erent side.The dangerous part of this is that we\u2019re all trying to learnabout what works and what doesn\u2019t with money.What investing strategies work? Which ones don\u2019t?What business strategies work? Which ones don\u2019t?How do you get rich? How do you avoid being poor?We tend to seek out these lessons by observing successesand failures and saying,", "\u201cDo what she did, avoid what hedid.\u201dIf we had a magic wand we would \ufb01nd out exactly whatproportion of these outcomes were caused by actions thatare repeatable, versus the role of random risk and luck thatswayed those actions one way or the other. But we don\u2019thave a magic wand. We have brains that prefer easy", "answers without much appetite for nuance. So identifyingthe traits we should emulate or avoid can be agonizinglyhard.Let me tell you another story of someone who, like BillGates, was wildly successful, but whose success is hard topin down as being caused by luck or skill. Cornelius Vanderbilt had just \ufb01nished a series of businessdeals to expand his railroad empire.One of his business advisors leaned in to tell Vanderbilt thatevery transaction he agreed to broke the law.\u201cMy God, John,\u201d said Vanderbilt, \u201cYou don\u2019t suppose you canrun a railroad in accordance with the statutes of the State ofNew York, do you?\u201d\u00b9\u2070My \ufb01rst thought when reading this was: \u201cThat attitude iswhy he was so successful.\u201d Laws didn\u2019t accommodaterailroads during Vanderbilt\u2019s day. So he said \u201cto hell with it\u201dand went ahead anyway.Vanderbilt was wildly successful. So it\u2019s tempting to view hislaw-\ufb02aunting\u2014which was notorious and vital to his success\u2014as sage wisdom. That scrappy visionary let nothing get inhis way!But how dangerous is that analysis? No sane person wouldrecommend \ufb02agrant crime as an entrepreneurial trait. Youcan easily imagine Vanderbilt\u2019s story turning out muchdi\ufb00erent\u2014an outlaw whose young company collapsed undercourt order.", "So we have a problem here.You can praise Vanderbilt for \ufb02aunting the law with as muchpassion as you criticize Enron for doing the same. Perhapsone got lucky by avoiding the arm of the law while the otherfound itself on the side of risk.John D. Rockefeller is similar. His frequent circumventing ofthe law\u2014a judge once called his company \u201cno better than acommon thief\u201d\u2014is often portrayed by historians as cunningbusiness smarts. Maybe it was. But when does the narrativeshift from, \u201cYou didn\u2019t let outdated laws get in the way ofinnovation,\u201d to \u201cYou committed a crime?\u201d Or how littlewould the story have to shift for the narrative to have turnedfrom \u201cRockefeller was a genius, try to learn from hissuccesses,\u201d to \u201cRockefeller was a criminal, try to learn fromhis business failures.\u201d Very little.\u201cWhat do I care about the law?\u201d Vanderbilt once said. \u201cAin\u2019t Igot the power?\u201dHe did, and it worked. But it\u2019s easy to imagine those beingthe last words of a story with a very di\ufb00erent outcome. Theline between bold and reckless can be thin. When we don\u2019tgive risk and luck their proper billing it\u2019s often invisible.Benjamin Graham is known as one of the greatest investorsof all time, the father of value investing and", "the earlymentor of Warren Bu\ufb00ett. But the majority of BenjaminGraham\u2019s investing success was due to owning an enormouschunk of GEICO stock which, by his own admission, brokenearly every diversi\ufb01cation rule that Graham himself laid outin his famous texts. Where does the thin line between boldand reckless fall here? I don\u2019t know. Graham wrote about hisGEICO bonanza: \u201cOne lucky break, or one supremely shrewddecision\u2014can we tell them apart?\u201d Not easily.", "We similarly think Mark Zuckerberg is a genius for turningdown Yahoo!\u2019s 2006 $1 billion o\ufb00er to buy his company. Hesaw the future and stuck to his guns. But people criticizeYahoo! with as much passion for turning down its own bigbuyout o\ufb00er from Microsoft\u2014those fools should have cashedout while they could! What is the lesson for entrepreneurshere? I have no idea, because risk and luck are so hard topin down.There are so many examples of this.Countless fortunes (and failures) owe their outcome toleverage.The best (and worst) managers drive their employees ashard as they can.\u201cThe customer is always right\u201d and \u201ccustomers don\u2019t knowwhat they want\u201d are both accepted business wisdom.The line between \u201cinspiringly bold\u201d and \u201cfoolishly reckless\u201dcan be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight.Risk and luck are doppelgangers.This is not an easy problem to solve. The di\ufb03culty inidentifying what is luck, what is skill, and what is risk is oneof the biggest problems we face when trying to learn aboutthe best way to manage money.But two things can point you in a better direction. Be careful who you praise and admire. Be carefulwho you look down upon and wish to avoidbecoming.", "Or, just be careful when assuming that 100% of outcomescan be attributed to e\ufb00ort and decisions. After my son wasborn, I wrote him a letter that said, in part: Some people are born into families that encourageeducation; others are against it. Some are born into\ufb02ourishing economies encouraging of entrepreneurship;others are born into war and destitution. I want you to besuccessful, and I want you to earn it. But realize that not allsuccess is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due tolaziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, includingyourself. Therefore, focus less on speci\ufb01c individuals and casestudies and more on broad patterns. Studying a speci\ufb01c person can be dangerous because wetend to study extreme examples\u2014the billionaires, the CEOs,or the massive failures that dominate the news\u2014andextreme examples are often the least applicable to othersituations, given their complexity. The more extreme theoutcome, the less likely you can apply its lessons to yourown life, because the more likely the outcome wasin\ufb02uenced by extreme ends of luck or risk.You\u2019ll get closer to actionable takeaways by looking forbroad patterns of success and failure. The more common thepattern, the more applicable it might be to your life. Tryingto emulate Warren Bu\ufb00ett\u2019s investment success", "is hard,because his results are so extreme that the role of luck in his", "lifetime performance is very likely high, and luck isn\u2019tsomething you can reliably emulate. But realizing, as we\u2019llsee in chapter 7, that people who have control over theirtime tend to be happier in life is a broad and commonenough observation that you can do something with it.My favorite historian, Frederick Lewis Allen, spent his careerdepicting the life of the average, median American\u2014howthey lived, how they changed, what they did for work, whatthey ate for dinner, etc. There are more relevant lessons totake away from this kind of broad observation than there arein studying the extreme characters that tend to dominatethe news. Bill Gates once said, \u201cSuccess is a lousy teacher. It seducessmart people into thinking they can\u2019t lose.\u201dWhen things are going extremely well, realize it\u2019s not asgood as you think. You are not invincible, and if youacknowledge that luck brought you success then you haveto believe in luck\u2019s cousin, risk, which can turn your storyaround just as quickly.But the same is true in the other direction.Failure can be a lousy teacher, because it seduces smartpeople into thinking their decisions were terrible whensometimes they just re\ufb02ect the unforgiving realities of risk.The trick when dealing with failure is arranging your\ufb01nancial life in a", "way that a bad investment here and amissed \ufb01nancial goal there won\u2019t wipe you out so you cankeep playing until the odds fall in your favor.", "But more important is that as much as we recognize the roleof luck in success, the role of risk means we should forgiveourselves and leave room for understanding when judgingfailures.Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.Now let\u2019s look at the stories of two men who pushed theirluck."]}, "chapter 4": {"name": "Never Enough", "text": ["John Bogle, the Vanguard founder who passed away in 2019,once told a story about money that highlights something wedon\u2019t think about enough: At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, KurtVonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, ahedge fund manager, had made more money in a single daythan Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history. Heller responds, \u201cYes, but I havesomething he will never have \u2026 enough.\u201dEnough. I was stunned by the simple eloquence of that word\u2014stunned for two reasons: \ufb01rst, because I have been givenso much in my own life and, second, because Joseph Hellercouldn\u2019t have been more accurate.For a critical element of our society, including many of thewealthiest and most powerful among us, there seems to beno limit today on what enough entails. It\u2019s so smart, and so powerful.Let me o\ufb00er two examples of the dangers of not havingenough, and what they can teach us. Rajat Gupta was born in Kolkata and orphaned as ateenager. People talk about the privileged few who begin lifeon third base. Gupta couldn\u2019t even see the baseballstadium.", "What he went on to achieve from those beginnings wassimply phenomenal.By his mid 40s Gupta was CEO of McKinsey, the world\u2019smost prestigious consulting \ufb01rm. He retired in 2007 to takeon roles with the United Nations and the World EconomicForum. He partnered on philanthropic work with Bill Gates.He sat on the board of directors of \ufb01ve public companies.From the slums of Kolkata, Gupta had quite literally becomeone of the most successful businessmen alive.With his success came enormous wealth. By 2008 Guptawas reportedly worth $100 million.\u00b9\u00b9 It\u2019s an unfathomablesum of money to most. A \ufb01ve percent annual return on thatmuch money generates almost $600 an hour, 24 hours aday.He could have done anything he wanted in life.And what he wanted, by all accounts, wasn\u2019t to be a merecenta-millionaire. Rajat Gupta wanted to be a billionaire.And he wanted it badly.Gupta sat on the board of directors of Goldman Sachs,which surrounded him with some of the wealthiest investorsin the world. One investor, citing the paydays of privateequity tycoons, described Gupta like this: \u201cI think he wantsto be in that circle. That\u2019s a billionaire circle, right? Goldmanis like the hundreds of millions circle, right?\u201d\u00b9\u00b2Right. So Gupta found a lucrative side hustle.In 2008, as Goldman Sachs", "stared at the wrath of the\ufb01nancial crisis, Warren Bu\ufb00ett planned to invest $5 billioninto the bank to help it survive. As a Goldman boardmember Gupta learned of this transaction before the public.It was valuable information. Goldman\u2019s survival was in", "doubt and Bu\ufb00ett\u2019s backing would surely send its stocksoaring.Sixteen seconds after learning of the pending deal Gupta,who was dialed into the Goldman board meeting, hung upthe phone and called a hedge fund manager named RajRajaratnam. The call wasn\u2019t recorded, but Rajaratnamimmediately bought 175,000 shares of Goldman Sachs, soyou can guess what was discussed. The Bu\ufb00ett-Goldmandeal was announced to the public hours later. Goldmanstock surged. Rajaratnam made a quick $1 million.That was just one example of an alleged trend. The SECclaims Gupta\u2019s insider tips led to $17 million in pro\ufb01ts.It was easy money. And, for prosecutors, it was an eveneasier case.Gupta and Rajaratnam both went to prison for insidertrading, their careers and reputations irrevocably ruined.Now consider Bernie Mado\ufb00. His crime is well known. Mado\ufb00is the most notorious Ponzi schemer since Charles Ponzihimself. Mado\ufb00 swindled investors for two decades beforehis crime was revealed\u2014ironically just weeks after Gupta\u2019sendeavor.What\u2019s overlooked is that Mado\ufb00, like Gupta, was more thana fraudster. Before the Ponzi scheme that made Mado\ufb00famous he was a wildly successful and legitimatebusinessman.Mado\ufb00 was a market maker, a job that matches buyers andsellers of stocks. He was very good at it. Here\u2019s how The WallStreet Journal described Mado\ufb00\u2019s market-making \ufb01rm in1992:", "He has built a highly pro\ufb01table securities \ufb01rm, Bernard L.Mado\ufb00 Investment Securities, which siphons a huge volumeof stock trades away from the Big Board. The $740 millionaverage daily volume of trades executed electronically bythe Mado\ufb00 \ufb01rm o\ufb00 the exchange equals 9% of the New Yorkexchange\u2019s. Mr. Mado\ufb00\u2019s \ufb01rm can execute trades so quicklyand cheaply that it actually pays other brokerage \ufb01rms apenny a share to execute their customers\u2019 orders, pro\ufb01tingfrom the spread between bid and ask prices that moststocks trade for. This is not a journalist inaccurately describing a fraud yet tobe uncovered; Mado\ufb00\u2019s market-making business waslegitimate. A former sta\ufb00er said the market-making arm ofMado\ufb00\u2019s business made between $25 million and $50million per year.Bernie Mado\ufb00\u2019s legitimate, non-fraudulent business was byany measure a huge success. It made him hugely\u2014andlegitimately\u2014wealthy.And yet, the fraud.The question we should ask of both Gupta and Mado\ufb00 is whysomeone worth hundreds of millions of dollars would be sodesperate for more money that they risked everything inpursuit of even more.Crime committed by those living on the edge of survival isone thing. A Nigerian scam artist once told The New YorkTimes that he felt guilty for hurting others, but \u201cpoverty willnot make you feel the pain.\u201d\u00b9\u00b3", "What Gupta and Mado\ufb00 did is something di\ufb00erent. Theyalready had everything: unimaginable wealth, prestige,power, freedom. And they threw it all away because theywanted more.They had no sense of enough.They are extreme examples. But there are non-criminalversions of this behavior.The hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management was sta\ufb00edwith traders personally worth tens and hundreds of millionsof dollars each, with most of their wealth invested in theirown funds. Then they took so much risk in the quest formore that they managed to lose everything\u2014in 1998, in themiddle of the greatest bull market and strongest economy inhistory. Warren Bu\ufb00ett later put it: To make money they didn\u2019t have and didn\u2019t need, theyrisked what they did have and did need. And that\u2019s foolish. Itis just plain foolish. If you risk something that is important toyou for something that is unimportant to you, it just doesnot make any sense. There is no reason to risk what you have and need for whatyou don\u2019t have and don\u2019t need.It\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s as obvious as it is overlooked.Few of us will ever have $100 million, as Gupta or Mado\ufb00did. But a measurable percentage of those reading this bookwill, at some point in their life, earn a", "salary or have a sum", "of money su\ufb03cient to cover every reasonable thing theyneed and a lot of what they want.If you\u2019re one of them, remember a few things. 1. The hardest \ufb01nancial skill is getting the goalpostto stop moving. But it\u2019s one of the most important. If expectations rise withresults there is no logic in striving for more because you\u2019llfeel the same after putting in extra e\ufb00ort. It gets dangerouswhen the taste of having more\u2014more money, more power,more prestige\u2014increases ambition faster than satisfaction.In that case one step forward pushes the goalpost two stepsahead. You feel as if you\u2019re falling behind, and the only wayto catch up is to take greater and greater amounts of risk.Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealthand generating envy. Perhaps they go hand in hand; wantingto surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But lifeisn\u2019t any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it\u2019ssaid, is just results minus expectations. 2. Social comparison is the problem here. Consider a rookie baseball player who earns $500,000 ayear. He is, by any de\ufb01nition, rich. But say he plays on thesame team as Mike Trout, who has a 12-year, $430 millioncontract. By comparison, the rookie is broke.", "But then thinkabout Mike Trout. Thirty-six million dollars per year is an", "insane amount of money. But to make it on the list of thetop-ten highest-paid hedge fund managers in 2018 youneeded to earn at least $340 million in one year.\u00b9\u2074 That\u2019swho people like Trout might compare their incomes to. Andthe hedge fund manager who makes $340 million per yearcompares himself to the top \ufb01ve hedge fund managers, whoearned at least $770 million in 2018. Those top managerscan look ahead to people like Warren Bu\ufb00ett, whosepersonal fortune increased by $3.5 billion in 2018. Andsomeone like Bu\ufb00ett could look ahead to Je\ufb00 Bezos, whosenet worth increased by $24 billion in 2018\u2014a sum thatequates to more per hour than the \u201crich\u201d baseball playermade in a full year.The point is that the ceiling of social comparison is so highthat virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it\u2019s abattle that can never be won, or that the only way to win isto not \ufb01ght to begin with\u2014to accept that you might haveenough, even if it\u2019s less than those around you.A friend of mine makes an annual pilgrimage to Las Vegas.One year he asked a dealer: What games do you play, andwhat casinos do you play in? The dealer, stone-cold serious,replied: \u201cThe only way to", "win in a Las Vegas casino is to exitas soon as you enter.\u201dThat\u2019s exactly how the game of trying to keep up with otherpeople\u2019s wealth works, too. 3. \u201cEnough\u201d is not too little. The idea of having \u201cenough\u201d might look like conservatism,leaving opportunity and potential on the table.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201cEnough\u201d is realizing that the opposite\u2014an insatiableappetite for more\u2014will push you to the point of regret.The only way to know how much food you can eat is to eatuntil you\u2019re sick. Few try this because vomiting hurts morethan any meal is good. For some reason the same logicdoesn\u2019t translate to business and investing, and many willonly stop reaching for more when they break and are forcedto. This can be as innocent as burning out at work or a riskyinvestment allocation you can\u2019t maintain. On the other endthere\u2019s Rajat Guptas and Bernie Mado\ufb00s in the world, whoresort to stealing because every dollar is worth reaching forregardless of consequence.Whatever it is, the inability to deny a potential dollar willeventually catch up to you. 4. There are many things never worth risking, nomatter the potential gain. After he was released from prison Rajat Gupta told The NewYork Times he had learned a lesson: Don\u2019t get too attached to anything\u2014your reputation, youraccomplishments or any of it. I think about it now, whatdoes it matter? O.K., this thing unjustly destroyed myreputation.

Take the billion-yearhistory of ice ages, and what they teach us about growingyour money. Our scienti\ufb01c knowledge of Earth is younger than you mightthink. Understanding how the world works often involvesdrilling deep below its surface, something we haven\u2019t beenable to do until fairly recently. Isaac Newton calculated themovement of the stars hundreds of years before weunderstood some of the basics of our planet.It was not until the 19th century that scientists agreed thatEarth had, on multiple occasions, been covered in ice.\u00b9\u2075There was too much evidence to argue otherwise. All overthe world sat \ufb01ngerprints of a previously frozen world: hugeboulders strewn in random locations; rock beds scrapeddown to thin layers. Evidence became clear that there hadnot been one ice age, but \ufb01ve distinct ones we couldmeasure.The amount of energy needed to freeze the planet, melt itanew, and freeze it over yet again is staggering. What onEarth (literally) could be causing these cycles? It must bethe most powerful force on our planet.And it was. Just not in the way anyone expected.There were plenty of theories about why ice ages occurred.To account for their enormous geological in\ufb02uence thetheories were equally grand.", "The uplifting of mountainranges, it was thought, may have shifted the Earth\u2019s windsenough to alter the climate. Others favored the idea that ice", "was the natural state, interrupted by massive volcaniceruptions that warmed us up.But none of these theories could account for the cycle of iceages. The growth of mountain ranges or some massivevolcano may explain one ice age. It could not explain thecyclical repetition of \ufb01ve.In the early 1900s a Serbian scientist named MilutinMilankovi\u0107 studied the Earth\u2019s position relative to otherplanets and came up with the theory of ice ages that wenow know is accurate: The gravitational pull of the sun andmoon gently a\ufb00ect the Earth\u2019s motion and tilt toward thesun. During parts of this cycle\u2014which can last tens ofthousands of years\u2014each of the Earth\u2019s hemispheres gets alittle more, or a little less, solar radiation than they\u2019re usedto.And that is where the fun begins.Milankovi\u0107\u2019s theory initially assumed that a tilt of the Earth\u2019shemispheres caused ravenous winters cold enough to turnthe planet into ice. But a Russian meteorologist namedWladimir K\u00f6ppen dug deeper into Milankovi\u0107\u2019s work anddiscovered a fascinating nuance.Moderately cool summers, not cold winters, were the icyculprit.It begins when a summer never gets warm enough to meltthe previous winter\u2019s snow. The leftover ice base makes iteasier for snow to accumulate the following winter, whichincreases the odds of snow sticking around in the followingsummer,", "which attracts even more accumulation thefollowing winter. Perpetual snow re\ufb02ects more of the sun\u2019srays, which exacerbates cooling, which brings moresnowfall, and on and on. Within a few hundred years a", "seasonal snowpack grows into a continental ice sheet, andyou\u2019re o\ufb00 to the races.The same thing happens in reverse. An orbital tilt lettingmore sunlight in melts more of the winter snowpack, whichre\ufb02ects less light the following years, which increasestemperatures, which prevents more snow the next year, andso on. That\u2019s the cycle.The amazing thing here is how big something can growfrom a relatively small change in conditions. You start with athin layer of snow left over from a cool summer that no onewould think anything of and then, in a geological blink of aneye, the entire Earth is covered in miles-thick ice. Asglaciologist Gwen Schultz put it: \u201cIt is not necessarily theamount of snow that causes ice sheets but the fact thatsnow, however little, lasts.\u201dThe big takeaway from ice ages is that you don\u2019t needtremendous force to create tremendous results.If something compounds\u2014if a little growth serves as the fuelfor future growth\u2014a small starting base can lead to resultsso extraordinary they seem to defy logic. It can be so logic-defying that you underestimate what\u2019s possible, wheregrowth comes from, and what it can lead to.And so it is with money. More than 2,000 books are dedicated to how Warren Bu\ufb00ettbuilt his fortune. Many of", "them are wonderful. But few payenough attention to the simplest fact: Bu\ufb00ett\u2019s fortune isn\u2019tdue to just being a good investor, but being a good investorsince he was literally a child.", "As I write this Warren Bu\ufb00ett\u2019s net worth is $84.5 billion. Ofthat, $84.2 billion was accumulated after his 50th birthday.$81.5 billion came after he quali\ufb01ed for Social Security, inhis mid-60s.Warren Bu\ufb00ett is a phenomenal investor. But you miss a keypoint if you attach all of his success to investing acumen.The real key to his success is that he\u2019s been a phenomenalinvestor for three quarters of a century. Had he startedinvesting in his 30s and retired in his 60s, few people wouldhave ever heard of him.Consider a little thought experiment.Bu\ufb00ett began serious investing when he was 10 years old.By the time he was 30 he had a net worth of $1 million, or$9.3 million adjusted for in\ufb02ation.\u00b9\u2076What if he was a more normal person, spending his teensand 20s exploring the world and \ufb01nding his passion, and byage 30 his net worth was, say, $25,000?And let\u2019s say he still went on to earn the extraordinaryannual investment returns he\u2019s been able to generate (22%annually), but quit investing and retired at age 60 to playgolf and spend time with his grandkids.What would a rough estimate of his net worth be today?Not $84.5 billion.$11.9 million.99.9% less than his actual net worth.E\ufb00ectively all of Warren Bu\ufb00ett\u2019s", "\ufb01nancial success can betied to the \ufb01nancial base he built in his pubescent years and", "the longevity he maintained in his geriatric years.His skill is investing, but his secret is time.That\u2019s how compounding works.Think of this another way. Bu\ufb00ett is the richest investor of alltime. But he\u2019s not actually the greatest\u2014at least not whenmeasured by average annual returns.Jim Simons, head of the hedge fund RenaissanceTechnologies, has compounded money at 66% annuallysince 1988. No one comes close to this record. As we justsaw, Bu\ufb00ett has compounded at roughly 22% annually, athird as much.Simons\u2019 net worth, as I write, is $21 billion. He is\u2014and Iknow how ridiculous this sounds given the numbers we\u2019redealing with\u201475% less rich than Bu\ufb00ett.Why the di\ufb00erence, if Simons is such a better investor?Because Simons did not \ufb01nd his investment stride until hewas 50 years old. He\u2019s had less than half as many years tocompound as Bu\ufb00ett. If James Simons had earned his 66%annual returns for the 70-year span Bu\ufb00ett has built hiswealth he would be worth\u2014please hold your breath\u2014sixty-three quintillion nine hundred quadrillion seven hundredeighty-one trillion seven hundred eighty billion sevenhundred forty-eight million one hundred sixty thousanddollars.These are ridiculous, impractical numbers. The point is thatwhat seem like small changes in growth assumptions canlead to ridiculous, impractical numbers. And so when we arestudying why", "something got to become as powerful as it has\u2014why an ice age formed, or why Warren Bu\ufb00ett is so rich\u2014we often overlook the key drivers of success.", "I have heard many people say the \ufb01rst time they saw acompound interest table\u2014or one of those stories about howmuch more you\u2019d have for retirement if you began saving inyour 20s versus your 30s\u2014changed their life. But it probablydidn\u2019t. What it likely did was surprise them, because theresults intuitively didn\u2019t seem right. Linear thinking is somuch more intuitive than exponential thinking. If I ask youto calculate 8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8 in your head, you cando it in a few seconds (it\u2019s 72). If I ask you to calculate8\u00d78\u00d78\u00d78\u00d78\u00d78\u00d78\u00d78\u00d78, your head will explode (it\u2019s134,217,728).IBM made a 3.5 megabyte hard drive in the 1950s. By the1960s things were moving into a few dozen megabytes. Bythe 1970s, IBM\u2019s Winchester drive held 70 megabytes. Thendrives got exponentially smaller in size with more storage. Atypical PC in the early 1990s held 200\u2013500 megabytes.And then \u2026 wham. Things exploded.1999\u2014Apple\u2019s iMac comes with a 6 gigabyte hard drive.2003\u2014120 gigs on the Power Mac.2006\u2014250 gigs on the new iMac.2011\u2014\ufb01rst 4 terabyte hard drive.2017\u201460 terabyte hard drives.2019\u2014100 terabyte hard drives.Put that all together: From 1950 to 1990 we gained 296megabytes. From 1990 through today we gained 100 millionmegabytes.", "If you were a technology optimist in the 1950s you mayhave predicted that practical storage would become 1,000times larger. Maybe 10,000 times larger, if you wereswinging for the fences. Few would have said \u201c30 milliontimes larger within my lifetime.\u201d But that\u2019s what happened.The counterintuitive nature of compounding leads even thesmartest of us to overlook its power. In 2004 Bill Gatescriticized the new Gmail, wondering why anyone wouldneed a gigabyte of storage. Author Steven Levy wrote,\u201cDespite his currency with cutting-edge technologies, hismentality was anchored in the old paradigm of storagebeing a commodity that must be conserved.\u201d You never getaccustomed to how quickly things can grow.The danger here is that when compounding isn\u2019t intuitivewe often ignore its potential and focus on solving problemsthrough other means. Not because we\u2019re overthinking, butbecause we rarely stop to consider compounding potential.None of the 2,000 books picking apart Bu\ufb00ett\u2019s success aretitled This Guy Has Been Investing Consistently for Three-Quarters of a Century. But we know that\u2019s the key to themajority of his success. It\u2019s just hard to wrap your headaround that math because it\u2019s not intuitive.There are books on economic cycles, trading strategies, andsector bets. But the most powerful and important bookshould be called Shut Up And", "Wait. It\u2019s just one page with along-term chart of economic growth.The practical takeaway is that the counterintuitiveness ofcompounding may be responsible for the majority ofdisappointing trades, bad strategies, and successfulinvesting attempts.", "You can\u2019t blame people for devoting all their e\ufb00ort\u2014e\ufb00ort inwhat they learn and what they do\u2014to trying to earn thehighest investment returns. It intuitively seems like the bestway to get rich.But good investing isn\u2019t necessarily about earning thehighest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-o\ufb00 hits that can\u2019t be repeated. It\u2019s about earning pretty goodreturns that you can stick with and which can be repeatedfor the longest period of time. That\u2019s when compoundingruns wild.The opposite of this\u2014earning huge returns that can\u2019t beheld onto\u2014leads to some tragic stories.

Jesse Livermore was the greatest stock market trader of hisday. Born in 1877, he became a professional trader beforemost people knew you could do such a thing. By age 30 hewas worth the in\ufb02ation-adjusted equivalent of $100 million.By 1929 Jesse Livermore was already one of the most well-known investors in the world. The stock market crash thatyear that ushered in the Great Depression cemented hislegacy in history.More than a third of the stock market\u2019s value was wiped outin an October 1929 week whose days were later named BlackMonday, Black Tuesday, and Black Thursday.Livermore\u2019s wife Dorothy feared the worst when her husbandreturned home on October 29th. Reports of Wall Streetspeculators committing suicide were spreading across NewYork. She and her children greeted Jesse at the door in tears,while her mother was so distraught she hid in another room,screaming.", "Jesse, according to biographer Tom Rubython, stood confusedfor a few moments before realizing what was happening.He then broke the news to his family: In a stroke of geniusand luck, he had been short the market, betting stocks woulddecline.\u201cYou mean we are not ruined?\u201d Dorothy asked.\u201cNo darling, I have just had my best ever trading day\u2014we arefabulously rich and can do whatever we like,\u201d Jesse said.Dorothy ran to her mother and told her to be quiet.In one day Jesse Livermore made the equivalent of more than$3 billion.During one of the worst months in the history of the stockmarket he became one of the richest men in the world.As Livermore\u2019s family celebrated their unfathomable success,another man wandered the streets of New York indesperation.Abraham Germansky was a multimillionaire real estatedeveloper who made a fortune during the roaring 1920s. Asthe economy boomed, he did what virtually every othersuccessful New Yorker did in the late 1920s: bet heavily onthe surging stock market.On October 26th, 1929, The New York Times published anarticle that in two paragraphs portrays a tragic ending: Bernard H. Sandler, attorney of 225 Broadway, was askedyesterday morning by Mrs. Abraham Germansky of MountVernon to help \ufb01nd her husband, missing since Thursday", "Morning. Germansky, who is 50 years old and an east sidereal estate operator, was said by Sandler to have investedheavily in stocks.Sandler said he was told by Mrs. Germansky that a friend sawher husband late Thursday on Wall Street near the stockexchange. According to her informant, her husband wastearing a strip of ticker tape into bits and scattering it on thesidewalk as he walked toward Broadway. And that, as far as we know, was the end of AbrahamGermansky.Here we have a contrast.The October 1929 crash made Jesse Livermore one of therichest men in the world. It ruined Abraham Germansky,perhaps taking his life.But fast-forward four years and the stories cross paths again.After his 1929 blowout Livermore, over\ufb02owing withcon\ufb01dence, made larger and larger bets. He wound up farover his head, in increasing amounts of debt, and eventuallylost everything in the stock market.Broke and ashamed, he disappeared for two days in 1933. Hiswife set out to \ufb01nd him. \u201cJesse L. Livermore, the stock marketoperator, of 1100 Park Avenue missing and has not been seensince 3pm yesterday,\u201d The New York Times wrote in 1933.He returned, but his path was set. Livermore eventually tookhis own life.The timing was di\ufb00erent, but Germansky and Livermoreshared a character", "trait: They were both very good at getting", "wealthy, and equally bad at staying wealthy.Even if \u201cwealthy\u201d is not a word you\u2019d apply to yourself, thelessons from that observation apply to everyone, at all incomelevels.Getting money is one thing.Keeping it is another. If I had to summarize money success in a single word it wouldbe \u201csurvival.\u201dAs we\u2019ll see in chapter 6, 40% of companies successfulenough to become publicly traded lost e\ufb00ectively all of theirvalue over time. The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans has,on average, roughly 20% turnover per decade for causes thatdon\u2019t have to do with death or transferring money to anotherfamily member.\u00b9\u2077Capitalism is hard. But part of the reason this happens isbecause getting money and keeping money are two di\ufb00erentskills.Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, andputting yourself out there.But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. Itrequires humility, and fear that what you\u2019ve made can betaken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and anacceptance that at least some of what you\u2019ve made isattributable to luck, so past success can\u2019t be relied upon torepeat inde\ufb01nitely.", "Michael Moritz, the billionaire head of Sequoia Capital, wasasked by Charlie Rose why Sequoia was so successful. Moritzmentioned longevity, noting that some VC \ufb01rms succeed for\ufb01ve or ten years, but Sequoia has prospered for four decades.Rose asked why that was: Moritz: I think we\u2019ve always been afraid of going out ofbusiness. Rose: Really? So it\u2019s fear? Only the paranoid survive? Moritz: There\u2019s a lot of truth to that \u2026 We assume thattomorrow won\u2019t be like yesterday. We can\u2019t a\ufb00ord to rest onour laurels. We can\u2019t be complacent. We can\u2019t assume thatyesterday\u2019s success translates into tomorrow\u2019s good fortune. Here again, survival.Not \u201cgrowth\u201d or \u201cbrains\u201d or \u201cinsight.\u201d The ability to stickaround for a long time, without wiping out or being forced togive up, is what makes the biggest di\ufb00erence. This should bethe cornerstone of your strategy, whether it\u2019s in investing oryour career or a business you own.There are two reasons why a survival mentality is so key withmoney.One is the obvious: few gains are so great that they\u2019re worthwiping yourself out over.", "The other, as we saw in chapter 4, is the counterintuitivemath of compounding.Compounding only works if you can give an asset years andyears to grow. It\u2019s like planting oak trees: A year of growth willnever show much progress, 10 years can make a meaningfuldi\ufb00erence, and 50 years can create something absolutelyextraordinary.But getting and keeping that extraordinary growth requiressurviving all the unpredictable ups and downs that everyoneinevitably experiences over time.We can spend years trying to \ufb01gure out how Bu\ufb00ett achievedhis investment returns: how he found the best companies,the cheapest stocks, the best managers. That\u2019s hard. Lesshard but equally important is pointing out what he didn\u2019t do.He didn\u2019t get carried away with debt.He didn\u2019t panic and sell during the 14 recessions he\u2019s livedthrough.He didn\u2019t sully his business reputation.He didn\u2019t attach himself to one strategy, one world view, orone passing trend.He didn\u2019t rely on others\u2019 money (managing investmentsthrough a public company meant investors couldn\u2019t withdrawtheir capital).He didn\u2019t burn himself out and quit or retire.He survived. Survival gave him longevity. And longevity\u2014investing consistently from age 10 to at least age 89\u2014is whatmade compounding work wonders. That single point is whatmatters most when describing his success.", "To show you what I mean, you have to hear the story of RickGuerin.You\u2019ve likely heard of the investing duo of Warren Bu\ufb00ett andCharlie Munger. But 40 years ago there was a third memberof the group, Rick Guerin.Warren, Charlie, and Rick made investments together andinterviewed business managers together. Then Rick kind ofdisappeared, at least relative to Bu\ufb00ett and Munger\u2019s success.Investor Mohnish Pabrai once asked Bu\ufb00ett what happened toRick. Mohnish recalled: [Warren said] \u201cCharlie and I always knew that we wouldbecome incredibly wealthy. We were not in a hurry to getwealthy; we knew it would happen. Rick was just as smart asus, but he was in a hurry.\u201dWhat happened was that in the 1973\u20131974 downturn, Rickwas levered with margin loans. And the stock market wentdown almost 70% in those two years, so he got margin calls.He sold his Berkshire stock to Warren\u2014Warren actually said \u201cIbought Rick\u2019s Berkshire stock\u201d\u2014at under $40 a piece. Rickwas forced to sell because he was levered.\u00b9\u2078 Charlie, Warren, and Rick were equally skilled at gettingwealthy. But Warren and Charlie had the added skill ofstaying wealthy. Which, over time, is the skill that mattersmost.Nassim Taleb put it this way: \u201cHaving an \u2018edge\u2019 and survivingare two di\ufb00erent things: the", "\ufb01rst requires the second. Youneed to avoid ruin. At all costs.\u201d", "Applying the survival mindset to the real world comes downto appreciating three things. 1. More than I want big returns, I want to be\ufb01nancially unbreakable. And if I\u2019m unbreakable Iactually think I\u2019ll get the biggest returns, because I\u2019llbe able to stick around long enough for compoundingto work wonders. No one wants to hold cash during a bull market. They want toown assets that go up a lot. You look and feel conservativeholding cash during a bull market, because you becomeacutely aware of how much return you\u2019re giving up by notowning the good stu\ufb00. Say cash earns 1% and stocks return10% a year. That 9% gap will gnaw at you every day.But if that cash prevents you from having to sell your stocksduring a bear market, the actual return you earned on thatcash is not 1% a year\u2014it could be many multiples of that,because preventing one desperate, ill-timed stock sale can domore for your lifetime returns than picking dozens of big-timewinners.Compounding doesn\u2019t rely on earning big returns. Merelygood returns sustained uninterrupted for the longest periodof time\u2014especially in times of chaos and havoc\u2014will alwayswin.", "2. Planning is important, but the most important partof every plan is to plan on the plan not goingaccording to plan. What\u2019s the saying? You plan, God laughs. Financial andinvestment planning are critical, because they let you knowwhether your current actions are within the realm ofreasonable. But few plans of any kind survive their \ufb01rstencounter with the real world. If you\u2019re projecting yourincome, savings rate, and market returns over the next 20years, think about all the big stu\ufb00 that\u2019s happened in the last20 years that no one could have foreseen: September 11th, ahousing boom and bust that caused nearly 10 millionAmericans to lose their homes, a \ufb01nancial crisis that causedalmost nine million to lose their jobs, a record-breaking stock-market rally that ensued, and a coronavirus that shakes theworld as I write this.A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future \ufb01lledwith unknowns is everyone\u2019s reality.A good plan doesn\u2019t pretend this weren\u2019t true; it embraces itand emphasizes room for error. The more you need speci\ufb01celements of a plan to be true, the more fragile your \ufb01nanciallife becomes. If there\u2019s enough room for error in your savingsrate that you can say, \u201cIt\u2019d be great if the market returns", "8%a year over the next 30 years, but if it only does 4% a year I\u2019llstill be OK,\u201d the more valuable your plan becomes.Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but becausethey were mostly right in a situation that required things tobe exactly right. Room for error\u2014often called margin of safety\u2014is one of the most underappreciated forces in \ufb01nance. Itcomes in many forms: A frugal budget, \ufb02exible thinking, and", "a loose timeline\u2014anything that lets you live happily with arange of outcomes.It\u2019s di\ufb00erent from being conservative. Conservative isavoiding a certain level of risk. Margin of safety is raising theodds of success at a given level of risk by increasing yourchances of survival. Its magic is that the higher your marginof safety, the smaller your edge needs to be to have afavorable outcome. 3. A barbelled personality\u2014optimistic about thefuture, but paranoid about what will prevent you fromgetting to the future\u2014is vital. Optimism is usually de\ufb01ned as a belief that things will gowell. But that\u2019s incomplete. Sensible optimism is a belief thatthe odds are in your favor, and over time things will balanceout to a good outcome even if what happens in between is\ufb01lled with misery. And in fact you know it will be \ufb01lled withmisery. You can be optimistic that the long-term growthtrajectory is up and to the right, but equally sure that theroad between now and then is \ufb01lled with landmines, andalways will be. Those two things are not mutually exclusive.The idea that something can gain over the long run whilebeing a basketcase in the short run is not intuitive, but it\u2019show a lot of things work in life. By", "age 20 the average personcan lose roughly half the synaptic connections they had intheir brain at age two, as ine\ufb03cient and redundant neuralpathways are cleared out.

We need anintervention. We need to see a doctor!\u201d But you don\u2019t.

But you needshort-term paranoia to keep you alive long enough to exploitlong-term optimism.Jesse Livermore \ufb01gured this out the hard way.He associated good times with the end of bad times.

Berkeley.By most accounts he did not show particular promise in hisyouth. But by the 1990s Berggruen was, by any measure, oneof the most successful art dealers of all time.In 2000 Berggruen sold part of his massive collection ofPicassos, Braques, Klees, and Matisses to the Germangovernment for more than 100 million euros. It was such abargain that the Germans e\ufb00ectively considered it a donation.The private market value of the collection was well over a $1billion.That one person can collect huge quantities of masterpieces isastounding. Art is as subjective as it gets. How could anyonehave foreseen, early in life, what were to become the mostsought-after works of the century?You could say \u201cskill.\u201dYou could say \u201cluck.\u201dThe investment \ufb01rm Horizon Research has a third explanation.And it\u2019s very relevant to investors.\u201cThe great investors bought vast quantities of art,\u201d the \ufb01rmwrites.\u00b9\u2079 \u201cA subset of the collections turned out to", "be greatinvestments, and they were held for a su\ufb03ciently long period of", "time to allow the portfolio return to converge upon the return ofthe best elements in the portfolio. That\u2019s all that happens.\u201dThe great art dealers operated like index funds. They boughteverything they could. And they bought it in portfolios, notindividual pieces they happened to like. Then they sat andwaited for a few winners to emerge.That\u2019s all that happens.Perhaps 99% of the works someone like Berggruen acquired inhis life turned out to be of little value. But that doesn\u2019tparticularly matter if the other 1% turn out to be the work ofsomeone like Picasso. Berggruen could be wrong most of thetime and still end up stupendously right.A lot of things in business and investing work this way.

When most of what we payattention to is the result of a tail, it\u2019s easy to underestimatehow rare and powerful they are.Some tail-driven industries are obvious. Take venture capital.

These are establishedcorporations, not \ufb02y-by-night startups.

That is aspectacular return. That is success.Forty percent of the companies in the index were e\ufb00ectivelyfailures. But the 7% of components that performed extremelywell were more than enough to o\ufb00set the duds. Just like HeinzBerggruen, but with Microsoft and Walmart instead of Picassoand Matisse.Not only do a few companies account for most of the market\u2019sreturn, but within those companies are even more tail events.In 2018, Amazon drove 6% of the S&P 500\u2019s returns. AndAmazon\u2019s growth is almost entirely due to Prime and AmazonWeb Services, which itself are tail events in a company that hasexperimented with hundreds of products, from the Fire Phoneto travel agencies.Apple was responsible for almost 7% of the index\u2019s returns in2018.

Just over300 of them were during a recession. So by keeping her coolduring just the 22% of the time the economy was in or near arecession, Sue ends up with almost three-quarters more moneythan Jim or Tom.To give a more recent example: How you behaved as aninvestor during a few months in late 2008 and early 2009 willlikely have more impact on your lifetime returns thaneverything you did from 2000 to 2008.There is the old pilot quip that their jobs are \u201chours and hoursof boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.\u201d It\u2019s thesame in investing.

Born in 1910, his research took place during anage when psychology was overwhelmingly focused ondisorders that brought people down\u2014things like depression,anxiety, schizophrenia.Campbell wanted to know what made people happy. His1981 book, The Sense of Wellbeing in America, starts bypointing out that people are generally happier than manypsychologists assumed. But some were clearly doing betterthan others.

But there is little evidence that its citizens are, onaverage, happier today than they were in the 1950s, whenwealth and income were much lower\u2014even at the medianlevel and adjusted for in\ufb02ation.

But we\u2019vesimultaneously given up more control over our time. At best,those things cancel each other out.Median family income adjusted for in\ufb02ation was $29,000 in1955.\u00b2\u2078 In 2019 it was just over $62,000.

And a lot of the reason has to do withthe kind of jobs more of us now have.John D. Rockefeller was one of the most successfulbusinessmen of all time. He was also a recluse, spendingmost of his time by himself. He rarely spoke, deliberatelymaking himself inaccessible and staying quiet when youcaught his attention.", "A re\ufb01nery worker who occasionally had Rockefeller\u2019s earonce remarked: \u201cHe lets everybody else talk, while he sitsback and says nothing.\u201dWhen asked about his silence during meetings, Rockefelleroften recited a poem: A wise old owl lived in an oak,The more he saw the less he spoke,The less he spoke, the more he heard,Why aren\u2019t we all like that wise old bird? Rockefeller was a strange guy. But he \ufb01gured out somethingthat now applies to tens of millions of workers.Rockefeller\u2019s job wasn\u2019t to drill wells, load trains, or movebarrels. It was to think and make good decisions.Rockefeller\u2019s product\u2014his deliverable\u2014wasn\u2019t what he didwith his hands, or even his words. It was what he \ufb01gured outinside his head. So that\u2019s where he spent most of his timeand energy. Despite sitting quietly most of the day in whatmight have looked like free time or leisure hours to mostpeople, he was constantly working in his mind, thinkingproblems through.This was unique in his day. Almost all jobs duringRockefeller\u2019s time required doing things with your hands. In1870, 46% of jobs were in agriculture, and 35% were incrafts or manufacturing, according to economist RobertGordon. Few professions relied on a worker\u2019s brain. You", "didn\u2019t think; you labored, without interruption, and yourwork was visible and tangible.Today, that\u2019s \ufb02ipped.Thirty-eight percent of jobs are now designated as\u201cmanagers, o\ufb03cials, and professionals.\u201d These are decision-making jobs. Another 41% are service jobs that often rely onyour thoughts as much as your actions.More of us have jobs that look closer to Rockefeller than atypical 1950s manufacturing worker, which means our daysdon\u2019t end when we clock out and leave the factory. We\u2019reconstantly working in our heads, which means it feels likework never ends.If your job is to build cars, there is little you can do whenyou\u2019re not on the assembly line. You detach from work andleave your tools in the factory. But if your job is to create amarketing campaign\u2014a thought-based and decision job\u2014your tool is your head, which never leaves you. You might bethinking about your project during your commute, as you\u2019remaking dinner, while you put your kids to sleep, and whenyou wake up stressed at three in the morning. You might beon the clock for fewer hours than you would in 1950. But itfeels like you\u2019re working 24/7.Derek Thompson of The Atlantic once described it like this: If the operating equipment of the 21st century is a portabledevice, this", "means the modern factory is not a place at all. Itis the day itself. The computer age has liberated the tools ofproductivity from the o\ufb03ce.

The \ufb01rst idea\u2014simple, but easy to overlook\u2014is thatbuilding wealth has little to do with your income orinvestment returns, and lots to do with your savingsrate. A quick story about the power of e\ufb03ciency.In the 1970s the world looked like it was running out of oil.The calculation wasn\u2019t hard: The global economy used a lotof oil, the global economy was growing, and the amount ofoil we could drill couldn\u2019t keep up.We didn\u2019t run out of oil, thank goodness.

The United Statesuses 60% less energy per dollar of GDP today than it did in1950.\u00b3\u00b2 The average miles per gallon of all vehicles on theroad has doubled since 1975. A 1989 Ford Taurus (sedan)averaged 18.0 MPG. A 2019 Chevy Suburban (absurdly largeSUV) averages 18.1 MPG.The world grew its \u201cenergy wealth\u201d not by increasing theenergy it had, but by decreasing the energy it needed. U.S.oil and gas production has increased 65% since 1975, whileconservation and e\ufb03ciency has more than doubled what wecan do with that energy. So it\u2019s easy to see which hasmattered more.The important thing here is that \ufb01nding more energy islargely out of our control and shrouded in uncertainty,because it relies on a slippery mix of having the rightgeology, geography, weather, and geopolitics. But becomingmore e\ufb03cient with the energy we use is largely in ourcontrol.

Thepath forward looks hard and out of your control.If you view it as powered by your own frugality ande\ufb03ciency, the destiny is clearer.Wealth is just the accumulated leftovers after you spendwhat you take in. And since you can build wealth without ahigh income, but have no chance of building wealth withouta high savings rate, it\u2019s clear which one matters more. More importantly, the value of wealth is relative towhat you need. Say you and I have the same net worth.And say you\u2019re a better investor than me.

But if youhave \ufb02exibility you have the time to wait for no-braineropportunities to fall in your lap. This is a hidden return onyour savings.Savings in the bank that earn 0% interest might actuallygenerate an extraordinary return if they give you the\ufb02exibility to take a job with a lower salary but more purpose,or wait for investment opportunities that come when thosewithout \ufb02exibility turn desperate.

Julius Wagner-Jauregg was a 19th-century psychiatrist withtwo unique skills: He was good at recognizing patterns, andwhat others saw as \u201ccrazy\u201d he found merely \u201cbold.\u201dHis specialty was patients with severe neurosyphilis\u2014then afatal diagnosis with no known treatment. He began noticinga pattern: syphilis patients tended to recover if they had theadded misfortune of having prolonged fevers from anunrelated ailment.Wagner-Jauregg assumed this was due to a hunch that hadbeen around for centuries but doctors didn\u2019t understandwell: fevers play a role in helping the body \ufb01ght infection.So he jumped to the logical conclusion.", "In the early 1900s Wagner-Jauregg began injecting patientswith low-end strains of typhoid, malaria, and smallpox totrigger fevers strong enough to kill o\ufb00 their syphilis. Thiswas as dangerous as it sounds. Some of his patients diedfrom the treatment. He eventually settled on a weak versionof malaria, since it could be e\ufb00ectively countered withquinine after a few days of bone-rattling fevers.After some tragic trial and error his experiment worked.Wagner-Jauregg reported that 6 in 10 syphilis patientstreated with \u201cmalariotherapy\u201d recovered, compared toaround 3 in 10 patients left alone. He won the Nobel Prize inmedicine in 1927. The organization today notes: \u201cThe mainwork that concerned Wagner-Jauregg throughout hisworking life was the endeavour to cure mental disease byinducing a fever.\u201d\u00b3\u00b3Penicillin eventually made malariotherapy for syphilispatients obsolete, thank goodness. But Wagner-Jauregg isone of the only doctors in history who not only recognizedfever\u2019s role in \ufb01ghting infection, but also prescribed it as atreatment.Fevers have always been as feared as they are mysterious.Ancient Romans worshiped Febris, the Goddess whoprotected people from fevers. Amulets were left at templesto placate her, hoping to stave o\ufb00 the next round of shivers.But Wagner-Jauregg was onto something. Fevers are notaccidental nuisances. They do play a role in the body\u2019s roadto recovery. We now", "have better, more scienti\ufb01c evidence offever\u2019s usefulness in \ufb01ghting infection. A one-degreeincrease in body temperature has been shown to slow thereplication rate of some viruses by a factor of 200.\u201cNumerous investigators have identi\ufb01ed a better outcomeamong patients who displayed fever,\u201d one NIH paper", "writes.\u00b3\u2074 The Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital includes a sectionon its website to educate parents who may panic at theslightest rise in their child\u2019s temperature: \u201cFevers turn onthe body\u2019s immune system.

They\u2019retreated with drugs like Tylenol to reduce them as quickly asthey appear. Despite millions of years of evolution as adefense mechanism, no parent, no patient, few doctors, andcertainly no drug company views fever as anything but amisfortune that should be eliminated.These views do not match the known science. One studywas blunt: \u201cTreatment of fever is common in the ICU settingand likely related to standard dogma rather than evidence-based practice.\u201d\u00b3\u2076 Howard Markel, director of the Center forthe History of Medicine, once said of fever phobia: \u201cTheseare cultural practices that spread just as widely as theinfectious diseases that are behind them.\u201d\u00b3\u2077Why does this happen? If fevers are bene\ufb01cial, why do we\ufb01ght them so universally?I don\u2019t think it\u2019s complicated: Fevers hurt.

Investing has asocial component that\u2019s often ignored when viewed througha strictly \ufb01nancial lens.The second is that this is \ufb01ne. Jason Zweig, who conductedthe interview when Markowitz described how he invested,later re\ufb02ected: My own view is that people are neither rational norirrational. We are human. We don\u2019t like to think harder thanwe need to, and we have unceasing demands on ourattention. Seen in that light, there\u2019s nothing surprisingabout the fact that the pioneer of modern portfolio theorybuilt his initial portfolio with so little regard for his ownresearch. Nor is it surprising that he adjusted it later.\u00b3\u2078 Markowitz is neither rational or irrational. He\u2019s reasonable.What\u2019s often overlooked in \ufb01nance is that something can betechnically true but contextually nonsense.In 2008 a pair of researchers from Yale published a studyarguing young savers should supercharge their retirementaccounts", "using two-to-one margin (two dollars of debt forevery dollar of their own money) when buying stocks. Itsuggests investors taper that leverage as they age, which", "lets a saver take more risk when they\u2019re young and canhandle a magni\ufb01ed market rollercoaster, and less whenthey\u2019re older.Even if using leverage left you wiped out when you wereyoung (if you use two-to-one margin a 50% market dropleaves you with nothing) the researchers showed saverswould still be better o\ufb00 in the long run so long as theypicked themselves back up, followed the plan, and keptsaving in a two-to-one leveraged account the day after beingwiped out.The math works on paper. It\u2019s a rational strategy.But it\u2019s almost absurdly unreasonable.No normal person could watch 100% of their retirementaccount evaporate and be so unphased that they carry onwith the strategy undeterred. They\u2019d quit, look for adi\ufb00erent option, and perhaps sue their \ufb01nancial advisor.The researchers argued that when using their strategy \u201ctheexpected retirement wealth is 90% higher compared to life-cycle funds.\u201d It is also 100% less reasonable. There is, in fact, a rational reason to favor what look likeirrational decisions.Here\u2019s one: Let me suggest that you love your investments.This is not traditional advice. It\u2019s almost a badge of honor forinvestors to claim they\u2019re emotionless about theirinvestments, because it seems rational.", "But if lacking emotions about your strategy or the stocks youown increases the odds you\u2019ll walk away from them whenthey become di\ufb03cult, what looks like rational thinkingbecomes a liability. The reasonable investors who love theirtechnically imperfect strategies have an edge, becausethey\u2019re more likely to stick with those strategies.There are few \ufb01nancial variables more correlated toperformance than commitment to a strategy during its leanyears\u2014both the amount of performance and the odds ofcapturing it over a given period of time. The historical oddsof making money in U.S. markets are 50/50 over one-dayperiods, 68% in one-year periods, 88% in 10-year periods,and (so far) 100% in 20-year periods. Anything that keepsyou in the game has a quanti\ufb01able advantage.If you view \u201cdo what you love\u201d as a guide to a happier life, itsounds like empty fortune cookie advice. If you view it as thething providing the endurance necessary to put thequanti\ufb01able odds of success in your favor, you realize itshould be the most important part of any \ufb01nancial strategy.Invest in a promising company you don\u2019t care about, andyou might enjoy it when everything\u2019s going well. But whenthe tide inevitably turns you\u2019re suddenly losing money onsomething you\u2019re not interested in. It\u2019s a double burden, andthe path", "of least resistance is to move onto something else.If you\u2019re passionate about the company to begin with\u2014youlove the mission, the product, the team, the science,whatever\u2014the inevitable down times when you\u2019re losingmoney or the company needs help are blunted by the factthat at least you feel like you\u2019re part of somethingmeaningful. That can be the necessary motivation thatprevents you from giving up and moving on.", "There are several other times when it\u2019s \ufb01ne to be reasonableinstead of rational with money.There\u2019s a well-documented \u201chome bias,\u201d where peopleprefer to invest in companies from the country they live inwhile ignoring the other 95%+ of the planet. It\u2019s notrational, until you consider that investing is e\ufb00ectivelygiving money to strangers. If familiarity helps you take theleap of faith required to remain backing those strangers, it\u2019sreasonable.Day trading and picking individual stocks is not rational formost investors\u2014the odds are heavily against your success.But they\u2019re both reasonable in small amounts if they scratchan itch hard enough to leave the rest of your morediversi\ufb01ed investments alone. Investor Josh Brown, whoadvocates and mostly owns diversi\ufb01ed funds, onceexplained why he also owns a smattering of individualstocks: \u201cI\u2019m not buying individual stocks because I think I\u2019mgoing to generate alpha [outperformance]. I just love stocksand have ever since I was 20 years old. And it\u2019s my money, Iget to do whatever.\u201d Quite reasonable.Most forecasts about where the economy and the stockmarket are heading next are terrible, but making forecasts isreasonable. It\u2019s hard to wake up in the morning tellingyourself you have no clue what the future holds, even if it\u2019strue. Acting on investment forecasts is dangerous. But I", "getwhy people try to predict what will happen next year. It\u2019shuman nature. It\u2019s reasonable.Jack Bogle, the late founder of Vanguard, spent his career ona crusade to promote low-cost passive index investing. Manythought it interesting that his son found a career as anactive, high-fee hedge fund and mutual fund manager.Bogle\u2014the man who said high-fee funds violate \u201cthe", "humble rules of arithmetic\u201d\u2014invested some of his ownmoney in his son\u2019s funds.

But it isoften used by investors and economists as an unassailableguide to the future.Do you see the irony?Do you see the problem?It is smart to have a deep appreciation for economic andinvesting history. History helps us calibrate our expectations,study where people tend to go wrong, and o\ufb00ers a roughguide of what tends to work. But it is not, in any way, a mapof the future.A trap many investors fall into is what I call \u201chistorians asprophets\u201d fallacy: An overreliance on past data as a signal tofuture conditions in a \ufb01eld where innovation and change arethe lifeblood of progress.You can\u2019t blame investors for doing this. If you viewinvesting as a hard science, history should be a perfectguide to the future. Geologists can look at a billion years ofhistorical data and form models of how the earth behaves.So can meteorologists. And doctors\u2014kidneys operate thesame way in 2020 as they did in 1020.But investing is not a hard science.

Quite a few of them.That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to predict what they\u2019ll do next basedsolely on what they did in the past.The cornerstone of economics is that things change overtime, because the invisible hand hates anything staying toogood or too bad inde\ufb01nitely. Investor Bill Bonner oncedescribed how Mr. Market works: \u201cHe\u2019s got a \u2018Capitalism atWork\u2019 T-shirt on and a sledgehammer in his hand.\u201d Fewthings stay the same for very long, which means we can\u2019ttreat historians as prophets.The most important driver of anything tied to money is thestories people tell themselves and the preferences they havefor goods and services. Those things don\u2019t tend to sit still.They change with culture and generation. They\u2019re alwayschanging and always will.The mental trick we play on ourselves here is an over-admiration of people who have been there, done that, whenit comes to money. Experiencing speci\ufb01c events does notnecessarily qualify you to know what will happen next. Infact it rarely does, because experience leads toovercon\ufb01dence more than forecasting ability.Investor Michael Batnick once explained this well.Confronted with the argument that few investors areprepared for rising interest rates because", "they\u2019ve neverexperienced them\u2014the last big period of rising interestrates occurred almost 40 years ago\u2014he argued that it didn\u2019tmatter, because experiencing or even studying whathappened in the past might not serve as any guide to whatwill happen when rates rise in the future:", "So what? Will the current rate hike look like the last one, orthe one before that? Will di\ufb00erent asset classes behavesimilarly, the same, or the exact opposite?On the one hand, people that have been investing throughthe events of 1987, 2000 and 2008 have experienced a lotof di\ufb00erent markets. On the other hand, isn\u2019t it possible thatthis experience can lead to overcon\ufb01dence? Failing to admityou\u2019re wrong? Anchoring to previous outcomes? Two dangerous things happen when you rely too heavily oninvestment history as a guide to what\u2019s going to happennext. 1. You\u2019ll likely miss the outlier events that move theneedle the most. The most important events in historical data are the bigoutliers, the record-breaking events. They are what movethe needle in the economy and the stock market. The GreatDepression. World War II. The dot-com bubble. September11th. The housing crash of the mid-2000s. A handful ofoutlier events play an enormous role because they in\ufb02uenceso many unrelated events in their wake.Fifteen billion people were born in the 19th and 20thcenturies. But try to imagine how di\ufb00erent the globaleconomy\u2014and the whole world\u2014would be today if justseven of them never existed:", "Adolf Hitler Joseph Stalin Mao Zedong Gavrilo Princip Thomas Edison Bill Gates Martin Luther King I\u2019m not even sure that\u2019s the most meaningful list. But almosteverything about the world today\u2014from borders totechnology to social norms\u2014would be di\ufb00erent if theseseven people hadn\u2019t left their mark. Another way to put thisis that 0.00000000004% of people were responsible forperhaps the majority of the world\u2019s direction over the lastcentury.", "The same goes for projects, innovations, and events.Imagine the last century without: The Great Depression World War II The Manhattan Project Vaccines Antibiotics ARPANET September 11th The fall of the Soviet Union How many projects and events occurred in the 20thcentury? Billions, trillions\u2014who knows. But those eight", "alone impacted the world orders upon orders of magnitudemore than others.The thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate ishow easy it is to underestimate how things compound. How,for example, 9/11 prompted the Federal Reserve to cutinterest rates, which helped drive the housing bubble, whichled to the \ufb01nancial crisis, which led to a poor jobs market,which led tens of millions to seek a college education, whichled to $1.6 trillion in student loans with a 10.8% defaultrate. It\u2019s not intuitive to link 19 hijackers to the currentweight of student loans, but that\u2019s what happens in a worlddriven by a few outlier tail events.The majority of what\u2019s happening at any given moment inthe global economy can be tied back to a handful of pastevents that were nearly impossible to predict.The most common plot of economic history is the role ofsurprises. The reason surprises occur is not because ourmodels are wrong or our intelligence is low. It\u2019s because theodds that Adolf Hitler\u2019s parents argued on the evening ninemonths before he was born were the same as themconceiving a child. Technology is hard to predict because BillGates may have died from polio if Jonas Salk got cranky andgave up on his quest to \ufb01nd", "a vaccine. The reason wecouldn\u2019t predict the student loan growth is because anairport security guard may have con\ufb01scated a hijacker\u2019sknife on 9/11. That\u2019s all there is to it.The problem is that we often use events like the GreatDepression and World War II to guide our views of things likeworst-case scenarios when thinking about future investmentreturns. But those record-setting events had no precedentwhen they occurred. So the forecaster who assumes theworst (and best) events of the past will match the worst", "(and best) events of the future is not following history;they\u2019re accidentally assuming that the history ofunprecedented events doesn\u2019t apply to the future.Nassim Taleb writes in his book Fooled By Randomness: In Pharaonic Egypt \u2026 scribes tracked the high-water mark ofthe Nile and used it as an estimate for a future worst-casescenario. The same can be seen in the Fukushima nuclearreactor, which experienced a catastrophic failure in 2011when a tsunami struck. It had been built to withstand theworst past historical earthquake, with the builders notimagining much worse\u2014and not thinking that the worstpast event had to be a surprise, as it had no precedent. This is not a failure of analysis. It\u2019s a failure of imagination.Realizing the future might not look anything like the past isa special kind of skill that is not generally looked highlyupon by the \ufb01nancial forecasting community.At a 2017 dinner I attended in New York, Daniel Kahnemanwas asked how investors should respond when our forecastsare wrong. He said: Whenever we are surprised by something, even if we admitthat we made a mistake, we say, \u2018Oh I\u2019ll never make thatmistake again.\u2019 But, in fact, what you should learn when youmake a mistake because you did not anticipate something isthat", "the world is di\ufb03cult to anticipate. That\u2019s the correctlesson to learn from surprises: that the world is surprising.", "The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world issurprising. Not that we should use past surprises as a guideto future boundaries; that we should use past surprises asan admission that we have no idea what might happen next.The most important economic events of the future\u2014thingsthat will move the needle the most\u2014are things that historygives us little to no guide about. They will be unprecedentedevents. Their unprecedented nature means we won\u2019t beprepared for them, which is part of what makes them soimpactful. This is true for both scary events like recessionsand wars, and great events like innovation.I\u2019m con\ufb01dent in that prediction because surprises movingthe needle the most is the one forecast that\u2019s been accurateat virtually every point in history. 2. History can be a misleading guide to the future ofthe economy and stock market because it doesn\u2019taccount for structural changes that are relevant totoday\u2019s world. Consider a few big ones.The 401(k) is 42 years old. The Roth IRA is younger, createdin the 1990s. So personal \ufb01nancial advice and analysisabout how Americans save for retirement today is notdirectly comparable to what made sense just a generationago. We have new options. Things changed.Or take venture capital. It barely existed 25", "years ago. Thereare single venture capital funds today that are larger thanthe entire industry was a generation ago.\u2074\u2070 In his memoir,", "Nike founder Phil Knight wrote about his early days inbusiness: There was no such thing as venture capital. An aspiringyoung entrepreneur had very few places to turn, and thoseplaces were all guarded by risk-averse gatekeepers withzero imagination. In other words, bankers. What this means, in e\ufb00ect, is that all historical data goingback just a few decades about how startups are \ufb01nanced isout of date. What we know about investment cycles andstartup failure rates is not a deep base of history to learnfrom, because the way companies are funded today is sucha new historical paradigm.Or take public markets. The S&P 500 did not include\ufb01nancial stocks until 1976; today, \ufb01nancials make up 16%of the index. Technology stocks were virtually nonexistent 50years ago. Today, they\u2019re more than a \ufb01fth of the index.Accounting rules have changed over time. So havedisclosures, auditing, and the amount of market liquidity.Things changed.The time between U.S. recessions has changed dramaticallyover the last 150 years:", "The average time between recessions has grown from abouttwo years in the late 1800s to \ufb01ve years in the early 20thcentury to eight years over the last half-century.As I write this it looks like we\u2019re going into recession\u201412years since the last recession began in December 2007.That\u2019s the longest gap between recessions since before theCivil War.There are plenty of theories on why recessions have becomeless frequent. One is that the Fed is better at managing thebusiness cycle, or at least extending it. Another is that heavyindustry is more prone to boom-and-bust overproductionthan the service industries that dominated the last 50 years.", "The pessimistic view is that we now have fewer recessions,but when they occur they are more powerful than before.For our argument it doesn\u2019t particularly matter what causedthe change. What matters is that things clearly changed.To show how these historic changes should a\ufb00ect investingdecisions, consider the work of a man many believe to beone of the greatest investment minds of all time: BenjaminGraham.Graham\u2019s classic book, The Intelligent Investor, is more thantheory. It gives practical directions like formulas investorscan use to make smart investing decisions.I read Graham\u2019s book when I was a teenager, learning aboutinvesting for the \ufb01rst time. The formulas presented in thebook were appealing to me, because they were literallystep-by-step instructions on how to get rich. Just follow theinstructions. It seemed so easy.But something becomes clear when you try applying someof these formulas: few of them actually work.Graham advocated purchasing stocks trading for less thantheir net working assets\u2014basically cash in the bank minusall debts. This sounds great, but few stocks actually tradethat cheaply anymore\u2014other than, say, a penny stockaccused of accounting fraud.One of Graham\u2019s criteria instructs conservative investors toavoid stocks trading for more than 1.5 times book value. Ifyou followed this rule over the last decade you would haveowned almost", "nothing but insurance and bank stocks. Thereis no world where that is OK.The Intelligent Investor is one of the greatest investingbooks of all time. But I don\u2019t know a single investor who has", "done well implementing Graham\u2019s published formulas. Thebook is full of wisdom\u2014perhaps more than any otherinvestment book ever published. But as a how-to guide, it\u2019squestionable at best.What happened? Was Graham a showman who soundedgood but whose advice didn\u2019t work? Not at all. He was awildly successful investor himself.But he was practical. And he was a true contrarian. Hewasn\u2019t so wedded to investing ideas that he\u2019d stick withthem when too many other investors caught onto thosetheories, making them so popular as to render theirpotential useless. Jason Zweig\u2014who annotated a laterversion of Graham\u2019s book\u2014once wrote: Graham was constantly experimenting and retesting hisassumptions and seeking out what works\u2014not what workedyesterday but what works today. In each revised edition ofThe Intelligent Investor, Graham discarded the formulas hepresented in the previous edition and replaced them withnew ones, declaring, in a sense, that \u201cthose do not workanymore, or they do not work as well as they used to; theseare the formulas that seem to work better now.\u201dOne of the common criticisms made of Graham is that allthe formulas in the 1972 edition are antiquated. The onlyproper response to this criticism is to say: \u201cOf course theyare! They are the ones he used to replace the formulas inthe", "1965 edition, which replaced the formulas in the 1954edition, which, in turn, replaced the ones from the 1949edition, which were used to augment the original formulasthat he presented in Security Analysis in 1934.\u201d", "Graham died in 1976. If the formulas he advocated werediscarded and updated \ufb01ve times between 1934 and 1972,how relevant do you think they are in 2020? Or will be in2050?Just before he died Graham was asked whether detailedanalysis of individual stocks\u2014a tactic he became famous for\u2014remained a strategy he favored. He answered: In general, no. I am no longer an advocate of elaboratetechniques of security analysis in order to \ufb01nd superior valueopportunities. This was a rewarding activity, say, 40 yearsago, when our textbook was \ufb01rst published. But thesituation has changed a great deal since then.\u2074\u00b9 What changed was: Competition grew as opportunitiesbecame well known; technology made information moreaccessible; and industries changed as the economy shiftedfrom industrial to technology sectors, which have di\ufb00erentbusiness cycles and capital uses.Things changed.An interesting quirk of investing history is that the furtherback you look, the more likely you are to be examining aworld that no longer applies to today. Many investors andeconomists take comfort in knowing their forecasts arebacked up by decades, even centuries, of data. But sinceeconomies evolve, recent history is often the best guide tothe future, because it\u2019s more likely to include importantconditions that are relevant to the future.", "There\u2019s a common phrase in investing, usually usedmockingly, that \u201cIt\u2019s di\ufb00erent this time.\u201d If you need to rebutsomeone who\u2019s predicting the future won\u2019t perfectly mirrorthe past, say, \u201cOh, so you think it\u2019s di\ufb00erent this time?\u201d anddrop the mic. It comes from investor John Templeton\u2019s viewthat \u201cThe four most dangerous words in investing are, \u2018it\u2019sdi\ufb00erent this time.\u2019\u201dTempleton, though, admitted that it is di\ufb00erent at least 20%of the time. The world changes. Of course it does. And thosechanges are what matter most over time. Michael Batnickput it: \u201cThe twelve most dangerous words in investing are,\u2018The four most dangerous words in investing are, \u2018it\u2019sdi\ufb00erent this time.\u2019\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean we should ignore history when thinkingabout money. But there\u2019s an important nuance: The furtherback in history you look, the more general your takeawaysshould be. General things like people\u2019s relationship to greedand fear, how they behave under stress, and how theyrespond to incentives tend to be stable in time. The historyof money is useful for that kind of stu\ufb00.But speci\ufb01c trends, speci\ufb01c trades, speci\ufb01c sectors, speci\ufb01ccausal relationships about markets, and what people shoulddo with their money are always an example of evolution inprogress. Historians are not prophets.The question, then, is how should we think about and", "planfor the future? Let\u2019s take a look in the next chapter."]}, "chapter 14": {"name": "Room For Error", "text": ["Some of the best examples of smart \ufb01nancial behavior canbe found in an unlikely place: Las Vegas casinos.Not among all players, of course. But a tiny group ofblackjack players who practice card counting can teachordinary people something extraordinarily important aboutmanaging money: the importance of room for error. The fundamentals of blackjack card counting are simple: No one can know with certainty what card the dealer willdraw next. But by tracking what cards have already been dealt you cancalculate what cards remain in the deck. Doing so can tell you the odds of a particular card beingdrawn by the dealer. As a player, you bet more when the odds of getting a cardyou want are in your favor and less when they are againstyou.The mechanics of how this is done don\u2019t matter here. Whatmatters is that a blackjack card counter knows they areplaying a game of odds, not certainties. In any particular", "hand they think they have a good chance of being right, butknow there\u2019s a decent chance they\u2019re wrong. It might soundstrange given their profession, but their strategy reliesentirely on humility\u2014humility that they don\u2019t know, andcannot know exactly what\u2019s going to happen next, so playtheir hand accordingly. The card counting system worksbecause it tilts the odds ever so slightly from the house tothe player. But bet too heavily even when the odds seem inyour favor and, if you\u2019re wrong, you might lose so much thatyou don\u2019t have enough money to keep playing.There is never a moment when you\u2019re so right that you canbet every chip in front of you. The world isn\u2019t that kind toanyone\u2014not consistently, anyways. You have to give yourselfroom for error. You have to plan on your plan not goingaccording to plan.Kevin Lewis, a successful card counter portrayed in the bookBringing Down the House, wrote more about thisphilosophy: Although card counting is statistically proven to work, itdoes not guarantee you will win every hand\u2014let alone everytrip you make to the casino. We must make sure that wehave enough money to withstand any swings of bad luck.Let\u2019s assume you have roughly a 2 percent edge over thecasino. That still", "means the casino will win 49 percent of thetime. Therefore, you need to have enough money towithstand any variant swings against you. A rule of thumb isthat you should have at least a hundred basic units.Assuming you start with ten thousand dollars, you couldcomfortably play a hundred-dollar unit.", "History is littered with good ideas taken too far, which areindistinguishable from bad ideas. The wisdom in havingroom for error is acknowledging that uncertainty,randomness, and chance\u2014\u201cunknowns\u201d\u2014are an ever-presentpart of life. The only way to deal with them is by increasingthe gap between what you think will happen and what canhappen while still leaving you capable of \ufb01ghting anotherday. Benjamin Graham is known for his concept of margin ofsafety. He wrote about it extensively and in mathematicaldetail. But my favorite summary of the theory came when hementioned in an interview that \u201cthe purpose of the marginof safety is to render the forecast unnecessary.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to overstate how much power lies in that simplestatement.Margin of safety\u2014you can also call it room for error orredundancy\u2014is the only e\ufb00ective way to safely navigate aworld that is governed by odds, not certainties. And almosteverything related to money exists in that kind of world.Forecasting with precision is hard. This is obvious to the cardcounter, because no one could possibly know where aparticular card lies in a shu\ufb04ed deck. It\u2019s less obvious tosomeone asking, \u201cWhat will the average annual return ofthe stock market be over the next 10 years?\u201d or \u201cOn whatdate will I be able to", "retire?\u201d But they are fundamentally thesame. The best we can do is think about odds.Graham\u2019s margin of safety is a simple suggestion that wedon\u2019t need to view the world in front of us as black or white,predictable or a crapshoot. The grey area\u2014pursuing things", "where a range of potential outcomes are acceptable\u2014is thesmart way to proceed.But people underestimate the need for room for error inalmost everything they do that involves money. Stockanalysts give their clients price targets, not price ranges.Economic forecasters predict things with precise \ufb01gures;rarely broad probabilities. The pundit who speaks inunshakable certainties will gain a larger following than theone who says \u201cWe can\u2019t know for sure,\u201d and speaks inprobabilities.\u2074\u00b2We do this in all kinds of \ufb01nancial endeavors, especiallythose related to our own decisions. Harvard psychologistMax Bazerman once showed that when analyzing otherpeople\u2019s home renovation plans, most people estimate theproject will run between 25% and 50% over budget.\u2074\u00b3 Butwhen it comes to their own projects, people estimate thatrenovations will be completed on time and at budget. Oh,the eventual disappointment.Two things cause us to avoid room for error. One is the ideathat somebody must know what the future holds, driven bythe uncomfortable feeling that comes from admitting theopposite. The second is that you\u2019re therefore doing yourselfharm by not taking actions that fully exploit an accurateview of that future coming true.But room for error is underappreciated and misunderstood.It\u2019s often viewed as a conservative hedge, used by thosewho don\u2019t want to take much risk or aren\u2019t", "con\ufb01dent in theirviews. But when used appropriately, it\u2019s quite the opposite.Room for error lets you endure a range of potentialoutcomes, and endurance lets you stick around long enoughto let the odds of bene\ufb01ting from a low-probability outcome", "fall in your favor. The biggest gains occur infrequently, eitherbecause they don\u2019t happen often or because they take timeto compound. So the person with enough room for error inpart of their strategy (cash) to let them endure hardship inanother (stocks) has an edge over the person who getswiped out, game over, insert more tokens, when they\u2019rewrong.Bill Gates understood this well. When Microsoft was a youngcompany, he said he \u201ccame up with this incrediblyconservative approach that I wanted to have enough moneyin the bank to pay a year\u2019s worth of payroll even if we didn\u2019tget any payments coming in.\u201d Warren Bu\ufb00ett expressed asimilar idea when he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholdersin 2008: \u201cI have pledged\u2014to you, the rating agencies andmyself\u2014to always run Berkshire with more than ample cash... When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night\u2019ssleep for the chance of extra pro\ufb01ts.\u201d\u2074\u2074There are a few speci\ufb01c places for investors to think aboutroom for error.One is volatility. Can you survive your assets declining by30%? On a spreadsheet, maybe yes\u2014in terms of actuallypaying your bills and staying cash-\ufb02ow positive. But whatabout mentally? It is easy to underestimate what a 30%decline does to your psyche. Your con\ufb01dence may becomeshot at the very", "moment opportunity is at its highest. You\u2014or your spouse\u2014may decide it\u2019s time for a new plan, or newcareer. I know several investors who quit after lossesbecause they were exhausted. Physically exhausted.Spreadsheets are good at telling you when the numbers door don\u2019t add up. They\u2019re not good at modeling how you\u2019llfeel when you tuck your kids in at night wondering if theinvestment decisions you\u2019ve made were a mistake that willhurt their future. Having a gap between what you can", "technically endure versus what\u2019s emotionally possible is anoverlooked version of room for error.Another is saving for retirement. We can look at history andsee, for example, that the U.S. stock market has returned anannual average of 6.8% after in\ufb02ation since the 1870s. It\u2019s areasonable \ufb01rst approximation to use that as an estimate ofwhat to expect on your own diversi\ufb01ed portfolio when savingfor retirement. You can use those return assumptions toback into the amount of money you\u2019ll need to save eachmonth to achieve your target nestegg.But what if future returns are lower? Or what if long-termhistory is a good estimate of the long-term future, but yourtarget retirement date ends up falling in the middle of abrutal bear market, like 2009? What if a future bear marketscares you out of stocks and you end up missing a futurebull market, so the returns you actually earn are less thanthe market average? What if you need to cash out yourretirement accounts in your 30s to pay for a medicalmishap?The answer to those what ifs is, \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to retirelike you once predicted.\u201d Which can be a disaster.The solution is simple: Use room for error when estimatingyour future returns. This is more art than", "science. For myown investments, which I\u2019ll describe more in chapter 20, Iassume the future returns I\u2019ll earn in my lifetime will be \u2153lower than the historic average. So I save more than I wouldif I assumed the future will resemble the past. It\u2019s mymargin of safety. The future may be worse than \u2153 lowerthan the past, but no margin of safety o\ufb00ers a 100%guarantee. A one-third bu\ufb00er is enough to allow me to sleepwell at night. And if the future does resemble the past, I\u2019ll be", "pleasantly surprised. \u201cThe best way to achieve felicity is toaim low,\u201d says Charlie Munger. Wonderful. An important cousin of room for error is what I call optimismbias in risk-taking, or \u201cRussian roulette should statisticallywork\u201d syndrome: An attachment to favorable odds when thedownside is unacceptable in any circumstances.Nassim Taleb says, \u201cYou can be risk loving and yetcompletely averse to ruin.\u201d And indeed, you should.The idea is that you have to take risk to get ahead, but norisk that can wipe you out is ever worth taking. The odds arein your favor when playing Russian roulette. But thedownside is not worth the potential upside. There is nomargin of safety that can compensate for the risk.Same with money. The odds of many lucrative things are inyour favor. Real estate prices go up most years, and duringmost years you\u2019ll get a paycheck every other week. But ifsomething has 95% odds of being right, the 5% odds ofbeing wrong means you will almost certainly experience thedownside at some point in your life. And if the cost of thedownside is ruin, the upside the other 95% of the time likelyisn\u2019t worth the risk, no matter how appealing it looks.Leverage is the devil here. Leverage\u2014taking on debt", "tomake your money go further\u2014pushes routine risks intosomething capable of producing ruin. The danger is thatrational optimism most of the time masks the odds of ruinsome of the time. The result is we systematicallyunderestimate risk. Housing prices fell 30% last decade. Afew companies defaulted on their debt. That\u2019s capitalism. Ithappens. But those with high leverage had a double", "wipeout: Not only were they left broke, but being wiped outerased every opportunity to get back in the game at the verymoment opportunity was ripe. A homeowner wiped out in2009 had no chance of taking advantage of cheap mortgagerates in 2010. Lehman Brothers had no chance of investingin cheap debt in 2009. They were done.To get around this, I think of my own money as barbelled. Itake risks with one portion and am terri\ufb01ed with the other.This is not inconsistent, but the psychology of money wouldlead you to believe that it is. I just want to ensure I canremain standing long enough for my risks to pay o\ufb00. Youhave to survive to succeed. To repeat a point we\u2019ve made afew times in this book: The ability to do what you want,when you want, for as long as you want, has an in\ufb01nite ROI. Room for error does more than just widen the target aroundwhat you think might happen. It also helps protect you fromthings you\u2019d never imagine, which can be the mosttroublesome events we face.The Battle of Stalingrad during World War II was the largestbattle in history. With it came equally staggering stories ofhow people dealt with risk.One came in", "late 1942, when a German tank unit sat inreserve on grasslands outside the city. When tanks weredesperately needed on the front lines, something happenedthat surprised everyone: Almost none of them worked.Out of 104 tanks in the unit, fewer than 20 were operable.Engineers quickly found the issue. Historian William Craigwrites: \u201cDuring the weeks of inactivity behind the front lines,", "\ufb01eld mice had nested inside the vehicles and eaten awayinsulation covering the electrical systems.\u201dThe Germans had the most sophisticated equipment in theworld. Yet there they were, defeated by mice.You can imagine their disbelief. This almost certainly nevercrossed their minds. What kind of tank designer thinksabout mouse protection? Not a reasonable one. And not onewho studied tank history.But these kinds of things happen all the time. You can planfor every risk except the things that are too crazy to crossyour mind. And those crazy things can do the most harm,because they happen more often than you think and youhave no plan for how to deal with them.In 2006 Warren Bu\ufb00ett announced a search for his eventualreplacement. He said he needed someone \u201cgeneticallyprogrammed to recognize and avoid serious risks, includingthose never before encountered.\u201d\u2074\u2075I have seen this skill at work with startups my \ufb01rm,Collaborative Fund, has backed. Ask a founder to list thebiggest risks they face, and the usual suspects arementioned. But beyond the predictable struggles of runninga startup, here are a few issues we\u2019ve dealt with among ourportfolio companies: Water pipes broke, \ufb02ooding and ruining a company\u2019s o\ufb03ce. A company\u2019s o\ufb03ce was broken into three times.", "A company was kicked out of its manufacturing plant. A store was shut down after a customer called the healthdepartment because she didn\u2019t like that another customerbrought a dog inside. A CEO\u2019s email was spoofed in the middle of a fundraise thatrequired all of his attention. A founder had a mental breakdown. Several of these events were existential to the company\u2019sfuture. But none were foreseeable, because none hadpreviously happened to the CEOs dealing with theseproblems\u2014or anyone else they knew, for that matter. It wasunchartered territory.Avoiding these kinds of unknown risks is, almost byde\ufb01nition, impossible. You can\u2019t prepare for what you can\u2019tenvision.If there\u2019s one way to guard against their damage, it\u2019savoiding single points of failure.A good rule of thumb for a lot of things in life is thateverything that can break will eventually break. So if manythings rely on one thing working, and that thing breaks, you", "are counting the days to catastrophe. That\u2019s a single point offailure.Some people are remarkably good at avoiding single pointsof failure. Most critical systems on airplanes have backups,and the backups often have backups. Modern jets have fourredundant electrical systems. You can \ufb02y with one engineand technically land with none, as every jet must be capableof stopping on a runway with its brakes alone, without thrustreverse from its engines. Suspension bridges can similarlylose many of their cables without falling.The biggest single point of failure with money is a solereliance on a paycheck to fund short-term spending needs,with no savings to create a gap between what you thinkyour expenses are and what they might be in the future.The trick that often goes overlooked\u2014even by the wealthiest\u2014is what we saw in chapter 10: realizing that you don\u2019tneed a speci\ufb01c reason to save. It\u2019s \ufb01ne to save for a car, or ahome, or for retirement. But it\u2019s equally important to savefor things you can\u2019t possibly predict or even comprehend\u2014the \ufb01nancial equivalent of \ufb01eld mice.Predicting what you\u2019ll use your savings for assumes you livein a world where you know exactly what your futureexpenses will be, which no one does. I save a lot, and I haveno", "idea what I\u2019ll use the savings for in the future. Few\ufb01nancial plans that only prepare for known risks haveenough margin of safety to survive the real world.In fact, the most important part of every plan is planning onyour plan not going according to plan.Now, let me show you how this applies to you."]}, "chapter 15": {"name": "You\"ll Change", "text": ["Igrew up with a friend who came from neither privilege nornatural intellect, but was the hardest-working guy I knew.These people have a lot to teach because they have anun\ufb01ltered understanding of every inch of the road tosuccess.His life\u2019s mission and dream as a teenager was to be adoctor.

Imagining a goal in thecontext of the realistic life stresses that grow withcompetitive pursuits is something entirely di\ufb00erent.This has a big impact on our ability to plan for future\ufb01nancial goals. Every \ufb01ve-year-old boy wants to drive a tractor when theygrow up. Few jobs look better in the eyes of a young boywhose idea of a good job begins and ends with \u201cVroomvroom, beep beep, big tractor, here I come!\u201dThen many grow up and realize that driving a tractor maybeisn\u2019t the best career. Maybe they want something moreprestigious or lucrative.So as a teenager they dream of being a lawyer. Now theythink\u2014they know\u2014their plan is set. Law school and its costs,here we come.Then, as a lawyer, they face such long working hours thatthey rarely see their families.So perhaps they take a lower-paying job with \ufb02exible hours.Then they realize that childcare is so expensive that it", "consumes most of their paycheck, and they opt to be a stay-at-home parent. This, they conclude, is \ufb01nally the rightchoice.Then, at age 70, they realize that a lifetime of staying homemeans they\u2019re unprepared to a\ufb00ord retirement.Many of us wind through life on a similar trajectory. Only27% of college grads have a job related to their major,according to the Federal Reserve.\u2074\u2076 Twenty-nine percent ofstay-at-home parents have a college degree.\u2074\u2077 Few likelyregret their education, of course. But we shouldacknowledge that a new parent in their 30s may think aboutlife goals in a way their 18-year-old self making career goalswould never imagine.Long-term \ufb01nancial planning is essential. But things change\u2014both the world around you, and your own goals anddesires. It is one thing to say, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what thefuture holds.\u201d It\u2019s another to admit that you, yourself, don\u2019tknow today what you will even want in the future. And thetruth is, few of us do. It\u2019s hard to make enduring long-termdecisions when your view of what you\u2019ll want in the future islikely to shift.The End of History Illusion is what psychologists call thetendency for people to be keenly aware of how much they\u2019vechanged in the past, but to underestimate how much theirpersonalities, desires, and", "goals are likely to change in thefuture. Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert once said: At every stage of our lives we make decisions that willprofoundly in\ufb02uence the lives of the people we\u2019re going tobecome, and then when we become those people, we\u2019re notalways thrilled with the decisions we made. So young", "people pay good money to get tattoos removed thatteenagers paid good money to get. Middle-aged peoplerushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry.Older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adultsworked hard to gain. On and on and on.\u2074\u2078 \u201cAll of us,\u201d he said, \u201care walking around with an illusion\u2014anillusion that history, our personal history, has just come toan end, that we have just recently become the people thatwe were always meant to be and will be for the rest of ourlives.\u201d We tend to never learn this lesson. Gilbert\u2019s researchshows people from age 18 to 68 underestimate how muchthey will change in the future.You can see how this can impact a long-term \ufb01nancial plan.Charlie Munger says the \ufb01rst rule of compounding is tonever interrupt it unnecessarily. But how do you notinterrupt a money plan\u2014careers, investments, spending,budgeting, whatever\u2014when what you want out of lifechanges? It\u2019s hard. Part of the reason people like RonaldRead\u2014the wealthy janitor we met earlier in the book\u2014andWarren Bu\ufb00ett become so successful is because they keptdoing the same thing for decades on end, lettingcompounding run wild. But many of us evolve so much overa lifetime that we don\u2019t want to keep doing the same thingfor", "decades on end. Or anything close to it. So rather thanone 80-something-year lifespan, our money has perhapsfour distinct 20-year blocks.I know young people who purposefully live austere lives withlittle income, and they\u2019re perfectly happy with it. Then thereare those who work their tails o\ufb00 to pay for a life of luxury,and they\u2019re perfectly happy with that. Both have risks\u2014theformer risks being unprepared to raise a family or fund", "retirement, the latter risks regret that you spent youryouthful and healthy years in a cubicle.There is no easy solution to this problem. Tell a \ufb01ve-year-oldboy he should be a lawyer instead of a tractor driver and hewill disagree with every cell in his body.But there are two things to keep in mind when making whatyou think are long-term decisions.We should avoid the extreme ends of \ufb01nancialplanning. Assuming you\u2019ll be happy with a very lowincome, or choosing to work endless hours in pursuitof a high one, increases the odds that you\u2019ll one day\ufb01nd yourself at a point of regret. The fuel of the Endof History Illusion is that people adapt to mostcircumstances, so the bene\ufb01ts of an extreme plan\u2014the simplicity of having hardly anything, or the thrillof having almost everything\u2014wear o\ufb00. But thedownsides of those extremes\u2014not being able toa\ufb00ord retirement, or looking back at a life spentdevoted to chasing dollars\u2014become enduringregrets. Regrets are especially painful when youabandon a previous plan and feel like you have torun in the other direction twice as fast to make upfor lost time.Compounding works best when you can give a plan years ordecades to grow. This is true for not only savings but careersand relationships. Endurance", "is key. And when you considerour tendency to change who we are over time, balance atevery point in your life becomes a strategy to avoid futureregret and encourage endurance.Aiming, at every point in your working life, to have moderateannual savings, moderate free time, no more than a", "moderate commute, and at least moderate time with yourfamily, increases the odds of being able to stick with a planand avoid regret than if any one of those things fall to theextreme sides of the spectrum.We should also come to accept the reality ofchanging our minds. Some of the most miserableworkers I\u2019ve met are people who stay loyal to acareer only because it\u2019s the \ufb01eld they picked whendeciding on a college major at age 18. When youaccept the End of History Illusion, you realize thatthe odds of picking a job when you\u2019re not old enoughto drink that you will still enjoy when you\u2019re oldenough to qualify for Social Security are low.The trick is to accept the reality of change and move on assoon as possible.Jason Zweig, the Wall Street Journal investment columnist,worked with psychologist Daniel Kahneman on writingKahneman\u2019s book Thinking, Fast and Slow. Zweig once tolda story about a personality quirk of Kahneman\u2019s that servedhim well: \u201cNothing amazed me more about Danny than hisability to detonate what we had just done,\u201d Zweig wrote. Heand Kahneman could work endlessly on a chapter, but: The next thing you know, [Kahneman] sends a version soutterly transformed that it is unrecognizable: It beginsdi\ufb00erently, it", "ends di\ufb00erently, it incorporates anecdotes andevidence you never would have thought of, it draws onresearch that you\u2019ve never heard of.", "\u201cWhen I asked Danny how he could start again as if we hadnever written an earlier draft,\u201d Zweig continued, \u201che saidthe words I\u2019ve never forgotten: \u2018I have no sunk costs.\u2019\u201d\u2074\u2079Sunk costs\u2014anchoring decisions to past e\ufb00orts that can\u2019t berefunded\u2014are a devil in a world where people change overtime. They make our future selves prisoners to our past,di\ufb00erent, selves. It\u2019s the equivalent of a stranger makingmajor life decisions for you.Embracing the idea that \ufb01nancial goals made when youwere a di\ufb00erent person should be abandoned without mercyversus put on life support and dragged on can be a goodstrategy to minimize future regret.The quicker it\u2019s done, the sooner you can get back tocompounding.Next, let\u2019s talk about compounding\u2019s price of admission."]}, "chapter 16": {"name": "Nothing\"s Free", "text": ["Everything has a price, and the key to a lot of things withmoney is just \ufb01guring out what that price is and beingwilling to pay it.The problem is that the price of a lot of things is not obviousuntil you\u2019ve experienced them \ufb01rsthand, when the bill isoverdue.

Immelt\u2019s successor, who lasted 14months, learned this as well.Most things are harder in practice than they are in theory.Sometimes this is because we\u2019re overcon\ufb01dent.

Some car thieves will getaway with it. Many more will be caught and punished.Same thing with investing.Morningstar once looked at the performance of tacticalmutual funds, whose strategy is to switch between stocksand bonds at opportune times, capturing market returnswith lower downside risk.\u2075\u2070 They want the returns withoutpaying the price. The study focused on the mid-2010through late 2011 period, when U.S. stock markets wentwild on fears of a new recession and the S&P 500 declinedmore than 20%.

One of its many faults stems from an era underformer CEO Jack Welch. Welch became famous for ensuringquarterly earnings per share beat Wall Street estimates. Hewas the grandmaster. If Wall Street analysts expected $0.25per share, Jack would deliver $0.26 no matter the state ofbusiness or the economy. He\u2019d do that by massaging thenumbers\u2014that description is charitable\u2014often pulling gainsfrom future quarters into the current quarter to make theobedient numbers salute their master.Forbes reported one of dozens of examples: \u201c[GeneralElectric] for two years in a row \u2018sold\u2019 locomotives tounnamed \ufb01nancial partners instead of end users intransactions that left most of the risks of ownership withGE.\u201d\u2075\u00b2Welch never denied this game. He wrote in his book StraightFrom the Gut: The response of our business leaders to the crises wastypical of the GE culture. Even though", "the books had closedon the quarter, many immediately o\ufb00ered to pitch in tocover the [earnings] gap. Some said they could \ufb01nd an extra", "$10 million, $20 million, and even $30 million from theirbusiness to o\ufb00set the surprise. The result was that under Welch\u2019s leadership, stockholdersdidn\u2019t have to pay the price.

GE shareholders have su\ufb00ered through adecade of mammoth losses that were previously shielded byaccounting maneuvers. The penny gains of Welch\u2019s erabecame dime losses today.The strangest example of this comes from failed mortgagegiants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which in the early2000s were caught under-reporting current earnings bybillions of dollars with the intention of spreading those gainsout over future periods to give investors the illusion ofsmoothness and predictability.\u2075\u00b3 The illusion of not having topay the price. The question is: Why do so many people who are willing topay the price of cars, houses, food, and vacations try so hardto avoid paying the price of good investment returns?The answer is simple: The price of investing success is notimmediately obvious. It\u2019s not a price tag you can see, sowhen the bill comes due it doesn\u2019t feel like a fee for gettingsomething good. It feels like a \ufb01ne for doing somethingwrong. And while people are", "generally \ufb01ne with paying fees,\ufb01nes are supposed to be avoided. You\u2019re supposed to makedecisions that preempt and avoid \ufb01nes. Tra\ufb03c \ufb01nes and IRS\ufb01nes mean you did something wrong and deserve to be", "punished. The natural response for anyone who watchestheir wealth decline and views that drop as a \ufb01ne is to avoidfuture \ufb01nes.It sounds trivial, but thinking of market volatility as a feerather than a \ufb01ne is an important part of developing thekind of mindset that lets you stick around long enough forinvesting gains to work in your favor.Few investors have the disposition to say, \u201cI\u2019m actually \ufb01neif I lose 20% of my money.\u201d This is doubly true for newinvestors who have never experienced a 20% decline.But if you view volatility as a fee, things look di\ufb00erent.Disneyland tickets cost $100. But you get an awesome daywith your kids you\u2019ll never forget. Last year more than 18million people thought that fee was worth paying. Few feltthe $100 was a punishment or a \ufb01ne. The worthwhiletradeo\ufb00 of fees is obvious when it\u2019s clear you\u2019re paying one.Same with investing, where volatility is almost always a fee,not a \ufb01ne.Market returns are never free and never will be. Theydemand you pay a price, like any other product. You\u2019re notforced to pay this fee, just like you\u2019re not forced to go toDisneyland. You can go to the local county fair where ticketsmight be $10, or stay home for", "free. You might still have agood time. But you\u2019ll usually get what you pay for. Samewith markets. The volatility/uncertainty fee\u2014the price ofreturns\u2014is the cost of admission to get returns greater thanlow-fee parks like cash and bonds.The trick is convincing yourself that the market\u2019s fee isworth it. That\u2019s the only way to properly deal with volatility", "and uncertainty\u2014not just putting up with it, but realizingthat it\u2019s an admission fee worth paying.There\u2019s no guarantee that it will be.

They ruin lives.Why do these things happen?And why do they keep happening?Why can\u2019t we learn our lessons?The common answer here is that people are greedy, andgreed is an indelible feature of human nature.That may be true, and it\u2019s a good enough answer for most.But remember from chapter 1: no one is crazy. People make\ufb01nancial decisions they regret, and they often do so withscarce information and without logic. But the decisionsmade sense to them when they were made. Blamingbubbles on greed and stopping there misses importantlessons about how and why people rationalize what inhindsight look like greedy decisions.Part of why bubbles are hard to learn from is that they arenot like cancer, where a biopsy gives us a clear warning anddiagnosis. They are closer to the rise and fall of a politicalparty, where the outcome is known in hindsight but thecause and blame are never agreed upon.Competition for investment returns is \ufb01erce, and someonehas to own every asset at every point in time. That meansthe mere idea", "of bubbles will always be controversial,", "because no one wants to think they own an overvaluedasset. In hindsight we\u2019re more likely to point cynical \ufb01ngersthan to learn lessons.I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever be able to fully explain why bubblesoccur. It\u2019s like asking why wars occur\u2014there are almostalways several reasons, many of them con\ufb02icting, all ofthem controversial.It\u2019s too complicated a subject for simple answers.But let me propose one reason they happen that both goesoverlooked and applies to you personally: Investors ofteninnocently take cues from other investors who are playing adi\ufb00erent game than they are. An idea exists in \ufb01nance that seems innocent but has doneincalculable damage.It\u2019s the notion that assets have one rational price in a worldwhere investors have di\ufb00erent goals and time horizons.Ask yourself: How much should you pay for Google stocktoday?The answer depends on who \u201cyou\u201d are.Do you have a 30-year time horizon? Then the smart price topay involves a sober analysis of Google\u2019s discounted cash\ufb02ows over the next 30 years.Are you looking to cash out within 10 years? Then the priceto pay can be \ufb01gured out by an analysis of the tech", "industry\u2019s potential over the next decade and whetherGoogle management can execute on its vision.Are you looking to sell within a year? Then pay attention toGoogle\u2019s current product sales cycles and whether we\u2019llhave a bear market.Are you a day trader? Then the smart price to pay is \u201cwhocares?\u201d because you\u2019re just trying to squeeze a few bucksout of whatever happens between now and lunchtime,which can be accomplished at any price.When investors have di\ufb00erent goals and time horizons\u2014andthey do in every asset class\u2014prices that look ridiculous toone person can make sense to another, because the factorsthose investors pay attention to are di\ufb00erent.Take the dot-com bubble in the 1990s.People can look at Yahoo! stock in 1999 and say \u201cThat wascrazy! A zillion times revenue! The valuation made nosense!\u201dBut many investors who owned Yahoo! stock in 1999 hadtime horizons so short that it made sense for them to pay aridiculous price. A day trader could accomplish what theyneed whether Yahoo! was at $5 a share or $500 a share aslong as it moved in the right direction that day. And it did,for years.An iron rule of \ufb01nance is that money chases returns to thegreatest extent that it can. If an asset has momentum\u2014it\u2019sbeen moving", "consistently up for a period of time\u2014it\u2019s notcrazy for a group of short-term traders to assume it will keepmoving up. Not inde\ufb01nitely; just for the short period of timethey need it to. Momentum attracts short-term traders in areasonable way.", "Then it\u2019s o\ufb00 to the races.Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returnsattracts enough money that the makeup of investors shiftsfrom mostly long term to mostly short term.That process feeds on itself. As traders push up short-termreturns, they attract even more traders. Before long\u2014and itoften doesn\u2019t take long\u2014the dominant market price-setterswith the most authority are those with shorter timehorizons.Bubbles aren\u2019t so much about valuations rising. That\u2019s just asymptom of something else: time horizons shrinking asmore short-term traders enter the playing \ufb01eld.It\u2019s common to say the dot-com bubble was a time ofirrational optimism about the future. But one of the mostcommon headlines of that era was announcing recordtrading volume, which is what happens when investors arebuying and selling in a single day. Investors\u2014particularly theones setting prices\u2014were not thinking about the next 20years. The average mutual fund had 120% annual turnoverin 1999, meaning they were, at most, thinking about thenext eight months. So were the individual investors whobought those mutual funds. Maggie Mahar wrote in her bookBull!: By the mid-nineties, the press had replaced annualscorecards with reports that appeared every three months.The change spurred investors to chase performance, rushingto buy the funds at the top of the charts, just when theywere most", "expensive.", "This was the era of day trading, short-term option contracts,and up-to-the minute market commentary. It\u2019s not the kindof thing you\u2019d associate with long-term views.The same thing happened during the housing bubble of themid-2000s.It\u2019s hard to justify paying $700,000 for a two-bedroomFlorida track home to raise your family in for the next 10years. But it makes perfect sense if you plan on \ufb02ipping thehome in a few months into a market with rising prices tomake a quick pro\ufb01t. Which is exactly what many peoplewere doing during the bubble.Data from Attom, a company that tracks real estatetransactions, shows the number of houses in America thatsold more than once in a 12-month period\u2014they were\ufb02ipped\u2014rose \ufb01vefold during the bubble, from 20,000 in the\ufb01rst quarter of 2000 to over 100,000 in the \ufb01rst quarter of2004.\u2075\u2074 Flipping plunged after the bubble to less than40,000 per quarter, where it\u2019s roughly remained since.Do you think these \ufb02ippers cared about long-term price-to-rent ratios? Or whether the prices they paid were backed upby long-term income growth? Of course not. Those numbersweren\u2019t relevant to their game. The only thing that matteredto \ufb02ippers was that the price of the home would be morenext month than it was this month. And for many", "years, itwas.You can say a lot about these investors. You can call themspeculators. You can call them irresponsible. You can shakeyour head at their willingness to take huge risks.But I don\u2019t think you can call all of them irrational.", "The formation of bubbles isn\u2019t so much about peopleirrationally participating in long-term investing. They\u2019reabout people somewhat rationally moving toward short-term trading to capture momentum that had been feedingon itself.What do you expect people to do when momentum createsa big short-term return potential? Sit and watch patiently?Never. That\u2019s not how the world works. Pro\ufb01ts will always bechased. And short-term traders operate in an area where therules governing long-term investing\u2014particularly aroundvaluation\u2014are ignored, because they\u2019re irrelevant to thegame being played.That\u2019s where things get interesting, and where the problemsbegin.Bubbles do their damage when long-term investors playingone game start taking their cues from those short-termtraders playing another.Cisco stock rose 300% in 1999 to $60 per share. At thatprice the company was valued at $600 billion, which isinsane. Few actually thought it was worth that much; theday-traders were just having their fun. Economist BurtonMalkiel once pointed out that Cisco\u2019s implied growth rate atthat valuation meant it would become larger than the entireU.S. economy within 20 years.But if you were a long-term investor in 1999, $60 was theonly price available to buy. And many people were buying itat that price. So you may have looked around and said toyourself, \u201cWow, maybe these other investors knowsomething I don\u2019t.\u201d", "Maybe you went along with it. You evenfelt smart about it.", "What you don\u2019t realize is that the traders who were settingthe marginal price of the stock were playing a di\ufb00erentgame than you were. Sixty dollars a share was a reasonableprice for the traders, because they planned on selling thestock before the end of the day, when its price wouldprobably be higher. But sixty dollars was a disaster in themaking for you, because you planned on holding shares forthe long run.These two investors rarely even know that each other exist.But they\u2019re on the same \ufb01eld, running toward each other.When their paths blindly collide, someone gets hurt. Many\ufb01nance and investment decisions are rooted in watchingwhat other people do and either copying them or bettingagainst them.

So much consumer spending, particularly indeveloped countries, is socially driven: subtly in\ufb02uenced bypeople you admire, and done because you subtly wantpeople to admire you.But while we can see how much money other people spendon cars, homes, clothes, and vacations, we don\u2019t get to seetheir goals, worries, and aspirations.

Stock markets around the world had collapsed. Theglobal \ufb01nancial system was on day-to-day life support.Unemployment was surging.As things looked like they couldn\u2019t get worse, The WallStreet Journal published a story arguing that we hadn\u2019t seenanything yet. It ran a front-page article on the outlook of aRussian professor named Igor Panarin whose economicviews rival the \ufb02air of science \ufb01ction writers.The Journal wrote: Around the end of June 2010, or early July, [Panarin] says,the U.S. will break into six pieces\u2014with Alaska reverting toRussian control ...

The nation was gutted bydefeat from World War II in every way\u2014economically,industrially, culturally, socially. A brutal winter in 1946caused a famine that limited food to less than 800 caloriesper person per day.\u2075\u2076Imagine if a Japanese academic had written a newspaperarticle during this time that said: Chin up, everyone. Within our lifetime our economy willgrow to almost 15 times the size it was before the end of thewar. Our life expectancy will nearly double. Our stock marketwill produce returns like any country in history has rarelyseen. We will go more than 40 years without ever seeingunemployment top 6%. We will become a world leader inelectronic innovation and corporate managerial systems.Before long we will be so rich that we will own some of themost prized real estate in the United States. Americans, bythe way, will be our closest ally and will try to copy oureconomic insights. They would have been summarily laughed", "out of the roomand asked to seek a medical evaluation.", "Keep in mind the description above is what actuallyhappened in Japan in the generation after the war. But themirror opposite of Panarin looks absurd in a way a forecastof doom doesn\u2019t.Pessimism just sounds smarter and more plausible thanoptimism.Tell someone that everything will be great and they\u2019re likelyto either shrug you o\ufb00 or o\ufb00er a skeptical eye. Tell someonethey\u2019re in danger and you have their undivided attention.If a smart person tells me they have a stock pick that\u2019s goingto rise 10-fold in the next year, I will immediately write themo\ufb00 as full of nonsense.If someone who\u2019s full of nonsense tells me that a stock I ownis about to collapse because it\u2019s an accounting fraud, I willclear my calendar and listen to their every word.Say we\u2019ll have a big recession and newspapers will call you.Say we\u2019re headed for average growth and no oneparticularly cares. Say we\u2019re nearing the next GreatDepression and you\u2019ll get on TV. But mention that goodtimes are ahead, or markets have room to run, or that acompany has huge potential, and a common reaction fromcommentators and spectators alike is that you are either asalesman or comically aloof of risks.The investing newsletter industry has known this for years,and is now", "populated by prophets of doom despiteoperating in an environment where the stock market hasgone up 17,000-fold in the last century (includingdividends).This is true beyond \ufb01nance. Matt Ridley wrote in his bookThe Rational Optimist:", "A constant drumbeat of pessimism usually drowns out anytriumphalist song ... If you say the world has been gettingbetter you may get away with being called na\u00efve andinsensitive. If you say the world is going to go on gettingbetter, you are considered embarrassingly mad. If, on theother hand, you say catastrophe is imminent, you mayexpect a McArthur genius award or even the Nobel PeacePrize. In my own adult lifetime ... the fashionable reasons forpessimism changed, but the pessimism was constant. \u201cEvery group of people I ask thinks the world is morefrightening, more violent, and more hopeless\u2014in short,more dramatic\u2014than it really is,\u201d Hans Rosling wrote in hisbook Factfulness.When you realize how much progress humans can makeduring a lifetime in everything from economic growth tomedical breakthroughs to stock market gains to socialequality, you would think optimism would gain moreattention than pessimism. And yet.The intellectual allure of pessimism has been known forages. John Stuart Mill wrote in the 1840s: \u201cI have observedthat not the man who hopes when others despair, but theman who despairs when others hope, is admired by a largeclass of persons as a sage.\u201dThe question is, why? And how does it impact how we thinkabout money?", "Let\u2019s repeat the premise that no one is crazy.There are valid reasons why pessimism is seductive whendealing with money. It just helps to know what they are toensure we don\u2019t take them too far.Part of it is instinctual and unavoidable. Kahneman says theasymmetric aversion to loss is an evolutionary shield. Hewrites: When directly compared or weighted against each other,losses loom larger than gains. This asymmetry between thepower of positive and negative expectations or experienceshas an evolutionary history. Organisms that treat threats asmore urgent than opportunities have a better chance tosurvive and reproduce. But a few other things make \ufb01nancial pessimism easy,common, and more persuasive than optimism. One is that money is ubiquitous, so something badhappening tends to a\ufb00ect everyone and captureseveryone\u2019s attention. That isn\u2019t true of, say, weather. A hurricane barreling downon Florida poses no direct risk to 92% of Americans. But arecession barreling down on the economy could impactevery single person\u2014including you, so pay attention.", "This goes for something as speci\ufb01c as the stock market.More than half of all American households directly ownstocks.\u2075\u2077 Even among those that don\u2019t, the stock market\u2019sgyrations are promoted so heavily in the media that the DowJones Industrial Average might be the stock-less household\u2019smost-watched economic barometer.Stocks rising 1% might be brie\ufb02y mentioned in the eveningnews. But a 1% fall will be reported in bold, all-caps lettersusually written in blood red. The asymmetry is hard to avoid.And while few question or try to explain why the marketwent up\u2014isn\u2019t it supposed to go up?\u2014there is almost alwaysan attempt to explain why it went down.Are investors worried about economic growth?Did the Fed screw things up again?Are politicians making bad decisions?Is there another shoe to drop?Narratives about why a decline occurred make them easierto talk about, worry about, and frame a story around whatyou think will happen next\u2014usually, more of the same.Even if you don\u2019t own stocks, those kind of things will grabyour attention. Only 2.5% of Americans owned stocks on theeve of the great crash of 1929 that sparked the GreatDepression. But the majority of Americans\u2014if not the world\u2014watched in amazement as the market collapsed,wondering what it signaled about their own fate. This wastrue", "whether you were a lawyer or a farmer or a carmechanic.Historian Eric Rauchway writes:", "This fall in value immediately a\ufb04icted only a few Americans.But so closely had the others watched the market andregarded it as an index of their fates that they suddenlystopped much of their economic activity. As the economistJoseph Schumpeter later wrote, \u201cpeople felt that the groundunder their feet was giving way.\u201d\u2075\u2078 There are two topics that will a\ufb00ect your life whether youare interested in them or not: money and health. Whilehealth issues tend to be individual, money issues are moresystemic. In a connected system where one person\u2019sdecisions can a\ufb00ect everyone else, it\u2019s understandable why\ufb01nancial risks gain a spotlight and capture attention in away few other topics can. Another is that pessimists often extrapolate presenttrends without accounting for how markets adapt. In 2008 environmentalist Lester Brown wrote: \u201cBy 2030China would need 98 million barrels of oil a day. The world iscurrently producing 85 million barrels a day and may neverproduce much more than that. There go the world\u2019s oilreserves.\u201d\u2075\u2079He\u2019s right. The world would run out of oil in that scenario.But that\u2019s not how markets work.There is an iron law in economics: extremely good andextremely bad circumstances rarely stay that way for long", "because supply and demand adapt in hard-to-predict ways.Consider what happened to oil immediately after Brown\u2019sprediction.Oil prices surged in 2008 as growing global demand\u2014muchof it from China\u2014crept up to potential output. A barrel of oilsold for $20 in 2001 and $138 by 2008.\u2076\u2070The new price meant drilling oil was like pulling gold out ofthe ground. The incentives for oil producers changeddramatically. Hard-to-tap oil supplies that weren\u2019t worth the\ufb01ght at $20 a barrel\u2014the cost of drilling didn\u2019t o\ufb00set theprice you could sell it for\u2014became the bonanza of a lifetimenow that you could sell a barrel for $138.That sparked a surge of new fracking and horizontal drillingtechnologies.The Earth has had roughly the same amount of oil reservesfor all of human history. And we\u2019ve known where the big oildeposits are for some time. What changes is the technologywe have that lets us economically pull the stu\ufb00 out of theground. Oil historian Daniel Yergin writes: \u201c86% of oilreserves in the United States are the result not of what isestimated at time of discovery but of the revisions\u201d thatcome when our technology improves.That\u2019s what happened as fracking took o\ufb00 in 2008. In theUnited States alone oil production went from roughly \ufb01vemillion barrels per day in 2008", "to 13 million by 2019.\u2076\u00b9World oil production is now over 100 million barrels per day\u2014some 20% above what Brown assumed was the highmark.To a pessimist extrapolating oil trends in 2008, of coursethings looked bad. To a realist who understood that", "necessity is the mother of all invention, it was far less scary.Assuming that something ugly will stay ugly is an easyforecast to make. And it\u2019s persuasive, because it doesn\u2019trequire imagining the world changing. But problems correctand people adapt. Threats incentivize solutions in equalmagnitude. That\u2019s a common plot of economic history thatis too easily forgotten by pessimists who forecast in straightlines. A third is that progress happens too slowly to notice,but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore. There are lots of overnight tragedies. There are rarelyovernight miracles.On January 5th, 1889, the Detroit Free Press pushed backagainst the long-held dream that man could one day \ufb02y likea bird. Airplanes, the paper wrote, \u201cappear impossible\u201d: The smallest possible weight of a \ufb02ying machine, with thenecessary fuel and engineer, could not be less than 300 or400 pounds \u2026 but there is a low limit of weight, certainlynot much beyond \ufb01fty pounds, beyond which it is impossiblefor an animal to \ufb02y. Nature has reached this limit, and withher utmost e\ufb00ort has failed to pass it. Six months later, Orville Wright dropped out of high schoolto help his brother, Wilbur, tinker in their backyard shed to", "build a printing press. It was the brothers\u2019 \ufb01rst jointinvention. It would not be their last.If you had to make a list of the most important inventions ofthe 20th century, the airplane would be at least top \ufb01ve, ifnot number one. The airplane changed everything. It startedworld wars, it ended world wars. It connected the world,bridging gaps between cities and rural communities; oceansand countries.But the story of the Wright Brothers\u2019 quest to build the \ufb01rstplane has a fascinating twist.After they conquered \ufb02ight, no one seemed to notice.Nobody seemed to care.In his 1952 book on American history, Frederick Lewis Allenwrote: Several years went by before the public grasped what theWrights were doing; people were so convinced that \ufb02yingwas impossible that most of those who saw them \ufb02yingabout Dayton [Ohio] in 1905 decided that what they hadseen must be some trick without signi\ufb01cance\u2014somewhat asmost people today would regard a demonstration of, say,telepathy. It was not until May, 1908\u2014nearly four and a halfyears after the Wright\u2019s \ufb01rst \ufb02ight\u2014that experiencedreporters were sent to observe what they were doing,experienced editors gave full credence to these reporters\u2019excited dispatches, and the world at last woke up to the factthat human \ufb02ight had been successfully accomplished.", "Even after people caught on to the plane\u2019s wonder, theyunderestimated it for years.First it was seen mainly as a military weapon. Then a richperson\u2019s toy. Then, perhaps, used to transport a few people.The Washington Post wrote in 1909: \u201cThere will never besuch a thing as commercial aerial freighters. Freight willcontinue to drag its slow weight across the patient earth.\u201dThe \ufb01rst cargo plane took o\ufb00 \ufb01ve months later.Now compare that slow, years-long awakening to becomingoptimistic about the airplane to how quickly people payattention to drivers of pessimism, like a corporatebankruptcy.Or a major war.Or a plane crash. Some of the \ufb01rst mentions of the Wright\u2019splane came in 1908 when an Army Lieutenant namedThomas Selfridge was killed during a demonstration \ufb02ight.\u2076\u00b2Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time.Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which canhappen in seconds, and loss of con\ufb01dence, which canhappen in an instant.It\u2019s easier to create a narrative around pessimism becausethe story pieces tend to be fresher and more recent.Optimistic narratives require looking at a long stretch ofhistory and developments, which people tend to forget andtake more e\ufb00ort to piece together.Consider the progress of medicine. Looking at the last yearwill do you little good. Any single decade", "won\u2019t do muchbetter. But looking at the last 50 years will show somethingextraordinary. For example, the age-adjusted death rate per", "capita from heart disease has declined more than 70% since1965, according to the National Institute of Health.\u2076\u00b3 A 70%decline in heart-disease death is enough to save somethinglike half a million American lives per year. Picture thepopulation of Atlanta saved every year. But since thatprogress happened so slowly, it captures less attention thanquick, sudden losses like terrorism, plane crashes, or naturaldisasters. We could have a Hurricane Katrina \ufb01ve times aweek, every week\u2014imagine how much attention that wouldreceive\u2014and it would not o\ufb00set the number of annual livessaved by the decline in heart disease in the last 50 years.This same thing applies to business, where it takes years torealize how important a product or company is, but failurescan happen overnight.And in stock markets, where a 40% decline that takes placein six months will draw congressional investigations, but a140% gain that takes place over six years can go virtuallyunnoticed.And in careers, where reputations take a lifetime to buildand a single email to destroy.The short sting of pessimism prevails while the powerful pullof optimism goes unnoticed.This underscores an important point made previously in thisbook: In investing you must identify the price of success\u2014volatility and loss amid the long backdrop of growth\u2014andbe willing to pay it.", "In 2004 The New York Times interviewed Stephen Hawking,the scientist whose incurable motor-neuron disease left him", "paralyzed and unable to talk at age 21.Through his computer, Hawking told the interviewer howexcited he was to sell books to lay people.\u201cAre you always this cheerful?\u201d the Times asked.\u201cMy expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21.Everything since then has been a bonus,\u201d he replied.Expecting things to be great means a best-case scenariothat feels \ufb02at. Pessimism reduces expectations, narrowingthe gap between possible outcomes and outcomes you feelgreat about.Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s so seductive.

Why are you more pessimistic?\u201dThere was one change the alien couldn\u2019t see between 2007and 2009: The stories we told ourselves about the economy.In 2007, we told a story about the stability of housing prices,the prudence of bankers, and the ability of \ufb01nancial marketsto accurately price risk.", "In 2009 we stopped believing that story.That\u2019s the only thing that changed.

Partly because the stakes areso high in investing. Get a few stock picks right and you canbecome rich without much e\ufb00ort. If there\u2019s a 1% chancethat someone\u2019s prediction will come true, and it coming truewill change your life, it\u2019s not crazy to pay attention\u2014just incase.And there are so many \ufb01nancial opinions that once you picka strategy or side, you become invested in them both\ufb01nancially and mentally.

But thebiggest risk is that you want something to be", "true so badlythat the range of your forecast isn\u2019t even in the sameballpark as reality.In its last 2007 meeting the Federal Reserve predicted whateconomic growth would be in 2008 and 2009.\u2076\u2077 Alreadyweary of a weakening economy, it was not optimistic. Itpredicted a range of potential growth\u20141.6% growth on thelow end, 2.8% on the high end. That was its margin of", "safety, its room for error. In reality the economy contractedby more than 2%, meaning the Fed\u2019s low-end estimate waso\ufb00 by almost threefold.It\u2019s hard for a policymaker to predict an outright recession,because a recession will make their careers complicated. Soeven worst-case projections rarely expect anything worsethan just \u201cslow-ish\u201d growth. It\u2019s an appealing \ufb01ction, and it\u2019seasy to believe because expecting anything worse is toopainful to consider.Policymakers are easy targets for criticism, but all of us dothis to some extent. And we do it in both directions. If youthink a recession is coming and you cash out your stocks inanticipation, your view of the economy is suddenly going tobe warped by what you want to happen. Every blip, everyanecdote, will look like a sign that doom has arrived\u2014maybenot because it has, but because you want it to.Incentives are a powerful motivator, and we should alwaysremember how they in\ufb02uence our own \ufb01nancial goals andoutlooks. It can\u2019t be overstated: there is no greater force in\ufb01nance than room for error, and the higher the stakes, thewider it should be. 2. Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. Butwe form a complete narrative to \ufb01ll in the gaps. My daughter is about a year old as", "I write this. She\u2019s curiousabout everything and learns so fast.But sometimes I think about all the stu\ufb00 she can\u2019tcomprehend.", "She has no idea why her dad goes to work every morning.The concept of bills, budgets, careers, promotions, andsaving for retirement are completely foreign to her.Imagine trying to explain the Federal Reserve, creditderivatives, or NAFTA to her. Impossible.But her world isn\u2019t dark. She does not wander around inconfusion.Even at a year old, she\u2019s written her own internal narrativeof how everything works. Blankets keep you warm, momsnuggles keep you safe, and dates taste good.Everything she comes across \ufb01ts into one of a few dozenmental models she\u2019s learned. When I go to work she doesn\u2019tstop in confusion, wondering what salary and bills are. Shehas a crystal clear explanation of the situation: Dad isn\u2019tplaying with me, and I wanted him to play with me, so I\u2019msad.Even though she knows little, she doesn\u2019t realize it, becauseshe tells herself a coherent story about what\u2019s going onbased on the little she does know.All of us, no matter our age, do the same thing.Just like my daughter, I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know. So Iam just as susceptible to explaining the world through thelimited set of mental models I have at my disposal.Like her, I look for the most understandable causes ineverything I come across. And,", "like her, I\u2019m wrong about alot of them, because I know a lot less about how the worldworks than I think I do.", "This is true for the most fact-based of subjects.Take history. It\u2019s just the recounting of stu\ufb00 that alreadyhappened. It should be clear and objective. But as B. H.Liddell Hart writes in the book Why Don\u2019t We Learn FromHistory?: [History] cannot be interpreted without the aid ofimagination and intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence isso overwhelming that selection is inevitable. Where there isselection there is art. Those who read history tend to look forwhat proves them right and con\ufb01rms their personalopinions. They defend loyalties. They read with a purpose toa\ufb03rm or to attack. They resist inconvenient truth sinceeveryone wants to be on the side of the angels. Just as westart wars to end all wars. Daniel Kahneman once told me about the stories people tellthemselves to make sense of the past. He said: Hindsight, the ability to explain the past, gives us theillusion that the world is understandable. It gives us theillusion that the world makes sense, even when it doesn\u2019tmake sense. That\u2019s a big deal in producing mistakes inmany \ufb01elds. Most people, when confronted with something they don\u2019tunderstand, do not realize they don\u2019t understand it becausethey\u2019re able to come up with an explanation that makessense based on their own unique", "perspective and", "experiences in the world, however limited those experiencesare. We all want the complicated world we live in to makesense. So we tell ourselves stories to \ufb01ll in the gaps of whatare e\ufb00ectively blind spots.What these stories do to us \ufb01nancially can be bothfascinating and terrifying.When I\u2019m blind to parts of how the world works I mightcompletely misunderstand why the stock market isbehaving like it is, in a way that gives me too muchcon\ufb01dence in my ability to know what it might do next. Partof the reason forecasting the stock market and the economyis so hard is because you are the only person in the worldwho thinks the world operates the way you do. When youmake decisions for reasons that I can\u2019t even comprehend, Imight follow you blindly into a decision that\u2019s right for youand disastrous to me. This, as we saw in chapter 16, is howbubbles form.Coming to terms with how much you don\u2019t know meanscoming to terms with how much of what happens in theworld is out of your control. And that can be hard to accept.Think about market forecasts. We\u2019re very, very bad at them.I once calculated that if you just assume that the marketgoes up every year", "by its historic average, your accuracy isbetter than if you follow the average annual forecasts of thetop 20 market strategists from large Wall Street banks. Ourability to predict recessions isn\u2019t much better. And since bigevents come out of nowhere, forecasts may do more harmthan good, giving the illusion of predictability in a worldwhere unforeseen events control most outcomes. CarlRichards writes: \u201cRisk is what\u2019s left over when you thinkyou\u2019ve thought of everything.\u201d", "People know this. I have not met an investor who genuinelythinks market forecasts as a whole are accurate or useful.But there\u2019s still tremendous demand for forecasts, in boththe media and from \ufb01nancial advisors.Why?Psychologist Philip Tetlock once wrote: \u201cWe need to believewe live in a predictable, controllable world, so we turn toauthoritative-sounding people who promise to satisfy thatneed.\u201dSatisfying that need is a great way to put it. Wanting tobelieve we are in control is an emotional itch that needs tobe scratched, rather than an analytical problem to becalculated and solved. The illusion of control is morepersuasive than the reality of uncertainty. So we cling tostories about outcomes being in our control.Part of this has to do with confusing \ufb01elds of precision with\ufb01elds of uncertainty.NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft passed by Pluto two yearsago. It was a three-billion mile trip that took nine and a halfyears. According to NASA, the trip \u201ctook about one minuteless than predicted when the craft was launched in January2006.\u201d\u2076\u2078Think about that. In an untested, decade-long journey,NASA\u2019s forecast was 99.99998% accurate. That\u2019s likeforecasting a trip from New York to Boston and beingaccurate to within four millionths of a second.But astrophysics is a \ufb01eld of precession. It isn\u2019t impacted bythe", "vagaries of human behavior and emotions, like \ufb01nanceis. Business, economics, and investing, are \ufb01elds ofuncertainty, overwhelmingly driven by decisions that can\u2019t", "easily be explained with clean formulas, like a trip to Plutocan. But we desperately want it to be like a trip to Pluto,because the idea of a NASA engineer being in 99.99998%control of an outcome is beautiful and comforting. It\u2019s socomforting that we\u2019re tempted to tell ourselves stories abouthow much control we have in other parts of our life, likemoney.Kahneman once laid out the path these stories take: When planning we focus on what we want to do and can do,neglecting the plans and skills of others whose decisionsmight a\ufb00ect our outcomes. Both in explaining the past and in predicting the future, wefocus on the causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck. We focus on what we know and neglect what we do notknow, which makes us overly con\ufb01dent in our beliefs. He described how this impacts businesses: I have had several occasions to ask founders andparticipants in innovative start-ups a question: To whatextent will the outcome of your e\ufb00ort depend on what youdo in your \ufb01rm? This is evidently an easy question; theanswer comes quickly and it has never been less than 80%.", "Even when they are not sure they will succeed, these boldpeople think their fate is almost entirely in their own hands.They are surely wrong: the outcome of a start-up depends asmuch on the achievements of its competitors and onchanges in the market as on its own e\ufb00orts. However,entrepreneurs naturally focus on what they know best\u2014theirplans and actions and the most immediate threats andopportunities, such as the availability of funding. They knowless about their competitors and therefore \ufb01nd it natural toimagine a future in which the competition plays little part. We all do this to some extent.And like my daughter, it doesn\u2019t bother us a bit.We don\u2019t wander around blind and confused. We have tothink the world we operate in makes sense based on whatwe happen to know. It\u2019d be too hard to get out of bed in themorning if you felt otherwise.But the alien circling over Earth?The one who\u2019s con\ufb01dent he knows what\u2019s happening basedon what he sees but turns out to be completely wrongbecause he can\u2019t know the stories going on inside everyoneelse\u2019s head?He\u2019s all of us."]}, "chapter 20": {"name": "All Together Now", "text": ["Congratulations, you\u2019re still reading.It\u2019s time to tie together a few things we\u2019ve learned.This chapter is a bit of a summary; a few short andactionable lessons that can help you make better \ufb01nancialdecisions.First, let me tell you a story about a dentist appointmentgone horribly awry. It teaches us something vital about thedangers of giving advice about what to do with your money. Clarence Hughes went to the dentist in 1931. His mouth wasradiating pain. His dentist put him under crude anesthesiato ease the pain. When Clarence awoke hours later he had16 fewer teeth and his tonsils removed.And then everything went wrong. Clarence died a week laterfrom his surgery\u2019s complications.His wife sued the dentist, but not because the surgery wentawry. Every surgery risked death in 1931.Clarence, she said, never consented to the procedures in the\ufb01rst place, and wouldn\u2019t if he were asked.The case wove through courts, but went nowhere. Consentbetween doctor and patient wasn\u2019t black and white in 1931.One court summed up the idea that doctors require freedomto make the best medical decisions: \u201cWithout such, wecould not enjoy the advancement of science.\u201dFor most of history the ethos of medicine was that thedoctor\u2019s job was to \ufb01x the patient, and what the patient", "thought about the doctor\u2019s treatment plans wasn\u2019t relevant.Dr. Jay Katz wrote about the philosophy in his book TheSilent World Between Doctor and Patient: Doctors felt that in order to accomplish that objective theywere obligated to attend to their patients\u2019 physical andemotional needs and to do so on their own authority,without consulting with their patients about the decisionsthat needed to be made. The idea that patients may also beentitled to sharing the burdens of decisions with theirdoctors was never part of the ethos of medicine. This wasn\u2019t ego or malice. It was a belief in two points: Every patient wants to be cured. There is a universal and right way to cure them. Not requiring patient consent in treatment plans makessense if you believe in those two points.But that\u2019s not how medicine works.In the last 50 years medical schools subtly shifted teachingaway from treating disease and toward treating patients.That meant laying out the options of treatment plans, andthen letting the patient decide the best path forward.", "This trend was partly driven by patient-protection laws,partly by Katz\u2019s in\ufb02uential book, which argued that patientshave wildly di\ufb00erent views about what\u2019s worth it inmedicine, so their beliefs have to be taken intoconsideration. Katz wrote: It is dangerous nonsense to assert that in the practice oftheir art and science physicians can rely on their benevolentintentions, their abilities to judge what is the right thing todo ... It is not that easy. Medicine is a complex professionand the interactions between physicians and patients arealso complex. That last line is important. \u201cMedicine is a complex professionand the interactions between physicians and patients arealso complex.\u201dYou know what profession is the same? Financial advice.I can\u2019t tell you what to do with your money, because I don\u2019tknow you.I don\u2019t know what you want. I don\u2019t know when you want it.I don\u2019t know why you want it.So I\u2019m not going to tell you what to do with your money. Idon\u2019t want to treat you like a dentist treated ClarenceHughes.But doctors and dentists aren\u2019t useless, obviously. They haveknowledge. They know the odds.

Chasing the highest returns or", "leveraging my assets to live the most luxurious life has littleinterest to me. Both look like games people do to impresstheir friends, and both have hidden risks. I mostly just wantto wake up every day knowing my family and I can dowhatever we want to do on our own terms. Every \ufb01nancialdecision we make revolves around that goal.My parents lived their adult years in two stages: dirt poorand moderately well o\ufb00. My father became a doctor when hewas 40 and already had three kids. Earning a doctor\u2019s salarydid not o\ufb00set the frugal mentality that is forced whensupporting three hungry kids while in medical school, andmy parents spent the good years living well below theirmeans with a high savings rate. This gave them a degree ofindependence. My father was an Emergency Room doctor,one of the highest-stress professions I can imagine and onethat requires a painful toggling of circadian rhythmsbetween night and day shifts. After two decades he decidedhe\u2019d had enough, so he stopped. Just quit. Moved onto thenext phase of his life.That stuck with me. Being able to wake up one morning andchange what you\u2019re doing, on your own terms, wheneveryou\u2019re ready, seems like the grandmother of all \ufb01nancialgoals. Independence, to", "me, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll stopworking. It means you only do the work you like with peopleyou like at the times you want for as long as you want.And achieving some level of independence does not rely onearning a doctor\u2019s income. It\u2019s mostly a matter of keepingyour expectations in check and living below your means.Independence, at any income level, is driven by your savingsrate. And past a certain level of income your savings rate isdriven by your ability to keep your lifestyle expectationsfrom running away.", "My wife and I met in college and moved in with each otheryears before we got married. After school we both had entry-level jobs with entry-level pay, and settled into a moderatelifestyle. All lifestyles exist on a spectrum, and what isdecent to one person can feel like royalty or poverty toanother. But at our incomes we got what we considered adecent apartment, a decent car, decent clothes, decentfood. Comfortable, but nothing close to fancy.Despite more than a decade of rising incomes\u2014myself in\ufb01nance, my wife in health care\u2014we\u2019ve more or less stayedat that lifestyle ever since. That\u2019s pushed our savings ratecontinuously higher. Virtually every dollar of raise hasaccrued to savings\u2014our \u201cindependence fund.\u201d We now liveconsiderably below our means, which tells you little aboutour income and more about our decision to maintain alifestyle that we established in our 20s.If there\u2019s a part of our household \ufb01nancial plan I\u2019m proud ofit\u2019s that we got the goalpost of lifestyle desires to stopmoving at a young age. Our savings rate is fairly high, butwe rarely feel like we\u2019re repressively frugal because ouraspirations for more stu\ufb00 haven\u2019t moved much. It\u2019s not thatour aspirations are nonexistent\u2014we like nice stu\ufb00 and livecomfortably.

Most of what we get pleasurefrom\u2014going for walks, reading, podcasts\u2014costs little, so werarely feel like we\u2019re missing out. On the rare occasion whenI question our savings rate I think of the independence myparents earned from years of high savings, and I quicklycome back. Independence is our top goal. A secondarybene\ufb01t of maintaining a lifestyle below what you can a\ufb00ordis avoiding the psychological treadmill of keeping up with", "the Joneses. Comfortably living below what you can a\ufb00ord,without much desire for more, removes a tremendousamount of social pressure that many people in the modern\ufb01rst world subject themselves to. Nassim Taleb explained:\u201cTrue success is exiting some rat race to modulate one\u2019sactivities for peace of mind.\u201d I like that.We\u2019re so far committed to the independence camp thatwe\u2019ve done things that make little sense on paper. We ownour house without a mortgage, which is the worst \ufb01nancialdecision we\u2019ve ever made but the best money decisionwe\u2019ve ever made. Mortgage interest rates were absurdly lowwhen we bought our house. Any rational advisor wouldrecommend taking advantage of cheap money andinvesting extra savings in higher-return assets, like stocks.But our goal isn\u2019t to be coldly rational; just psychologicallyreasonable.The independent feeling I get from owning our houseoutright far exceeds the known \ufb01nancial gain I\u2019d get fromleveraging our assets with a cheap mortgage. Eliminatingthe monthly payment feels better than maximizing the long-term value of our assets. It makes me feel independent.I don\u2019t try to defend this decision to those pointing out its\ufb02aws, or those who would never do the same. On paper it\u2019sdefenseless. But it works for us. We like it. That\u2019s whatmatters. Good decisions aren\u2019t always rational. At", "somepoint you have to choose between being happy or being\u201cright.\u201dWe also keep a higher percentage of our assets in cash thanmost \ufb01nancial advisors would recommend\u2014somethingaround 20% of our assets outside the value of our house.This is also close to indefensible on paper, and I\u2019m notrecommending it to others. It\u2019s just what works for us.", "We do it because cash is the oxygen of independence, and\u2014more importantly\u2014we never want to be forced to sell thestocks we own. We want the probability of facing a hugeexpense and needing to liquidate stocks to cover it to be asclose to zero as possible. Perhaps we just have a lower risktolerance than others.But everything I\u2019ve learned about personal \ufb01nance tells methat everyone\u2014without exception\u2014will eventually face ahuge expense they did not expect\u2014and they don\u2019t plan forthese expenses speci\ufb01cally because they did not expectthem. The few people who know the details of our \ufb01nancesask, \u201cWhat are you saving for? A house? A boat? A new car?\u201dNo, none of those. I\u2019m saving for a world where curveballsare more common than we expect. Not being forced to sellstocks to cover an expense also means we\u2019re increasing theodds of letting the stocks we own compound for the longestperiod of time. Charlie Munger put it well: \u201cThe \ufb01rst rule ofcompounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.\u201d How my family thinks about investing I started my career as a stock picker. At the time we onlyowned individual stocks, mostly large companies likeBerkshire Hathaway and Procter & Gamble, mixed withsmaller stocks I considered deep value investments. Go", "backto my 20s and at any given point I held something like 25individual stocks.I don\u2019t know how I did as a stock picker. Did I beat themarket? I\u2019m not sure. Like most who try, I didn\u2019t keep a goodscore. Either way, I\u2019ve shifted my views and now every stockwe own is a low-cost index fund.", "I don\u2019t have anything against actively picking stocks, eitheron your own or through giving your money to an active fundmanager. I think some people can outperform the marketaverages\u2014it\u2019s just very hard, and harder than most peoplethink.If I had to summarize my views on investing, it\u2019s this: Everyinvestor should pick a strategy that has the highest odds ofsuccessfully meeting their goals. And I think for mostinvestors, dollar-cost averaging into a low-cost index fundwill provide the highest odds of long-term success.That doesn\u2019t mean index investing will always work. Itdoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s for everyone. And it doesn\u2019t mean activestock picking is doomed to fail. In general, this industry hasbecome too entrenched on one side or the other\u2014particularly those vehemently against active investing.Beating the market should be hard; the odds of successshould be low. If they weren\u2019t, everyone would do it, and ifeveryone did it there would be no opportunity. So no oneshould be surprised that the majority of those trying to beatthe market fail to do so. (The statistics show 85% of large-cap active managers didn\u2019t beat the S&P 500 over thedecade ending 2019.)\u2077\u00b9I know people who think it\u2019s insane to try to beat the marketbut encourage their kids to reach for the", "stars and try tobecome professional athletes. To each their own. Life isabout playing the odds, and we all think about odds a littledi\ufb00erently.Over the years I came around to the view that we\u2019ll have ahigh chance of meeting all of our family\u2019s \ufb01nancial goals ifwe consistently invest money into a low-cost index fund fordecades on end, leaving the money alone to compound. A", "lot of this view comes from our lifestyle of frugal spending. Ifyou can meet all your goals without having to take theadded risk that comes from trying to outperform the market,then what\u2019s the point of even trying? I can a\ufb00ord to not bethe greatest investor in the world, but I can\u2019t a\ufb00ord to be abad one. When I think of it that way, the choice to buy theindex and hold on is a no-brainer for us. I know not everyonewill agree with that logic, especially my friends whose job itis to beat the market. I respect what they do. But this iswhat works for us.We invest money from every paycheck into these indexfunds\u2014a combination of U.S. and international stocks.There\u2019s no set goal\u2014it\u2019s just whatever is leftover after wespend. We max out retirement accounts in the same funds,and contribute to our kids\u2019 529 college savings plans.And that\u2019s about it. E\ufb00ectively all of our net worth is ahouse, a checking account, and some Vanguard index funds.It doesn\u2019t need to be more complicated than that for us. Ilike it simple. One of my deeply held investing beliefs is thatthere is little correlation between investment e\ufb00ort andinvestment results. The reason is because the world", "isdriven by tails\u2014a few variables account for the majority ofreturns. No matter how hard you try at investing you won\u2019tdo well if you miss the two or three things that move theneedle in your strategy. The reverse is true. Simpleinvestment strategies can work great as long as theycapture the few things that are important to that strategy\u2019ssuccess. My investing strategy doesn\u2019t rely on picking theright sector, or timing the next recession. It relies on a highsavings rate, patience, and optimism that the globaleconomy will create value over the next several decades.

So ofcourse there\u2019s a chance I\u2019ll change it in the future.No matter how we save or invest I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll always havethe goal of independence, and we\u2019ll always do whatevermaximizes for sleeping well at night.We think it\u2019s the ultimate goal; the mastery of thepsychology of money.But to each their own.

August, 1945. World War II ends. Japan surrendering was \u201cThe Happiest Day in American History,\u201d The New York Times wrote.But there\u2019s the saying, \u201cHistory is just one damn thing after another.\u201dThe joy of the war ending was quickly met with the question, \u201cWhat happens now?\u201dSixteen million Americans\u201411% of the population\u2014served in the war. About eight millionwere overseas at the end. Their average age was 23. Within 18 months all but 1.5 million ofthem would be home and out of uniform.And then what?What were they going to do next?Where were they going to work?Where were they going to live?Those were the most important questions of the day, for two reasons. One, no one knew theanswers. Two, if they couldn\u2019t be answered quickly, the most likely scenario\u2014in the eyes ofmany economists\u2014was that the economy would slip back into the depths of the GreatDepression.Three forces had built up during the war: Housing construction ground to a halt, as virtually all production capacity was shifted tobuilding war supplies. Fewer than 12,000 homes per month were built in 1943, equivalentto less than one new home per American city. Returning soldiers faced a severe housingshortage. The speci\ufb01c jobs created during the war\u2014building ships, tanks, and", "planes\u2014were verysuddenly not necessary after it, stopping with a speed and magnitude rarely seen in privatebusiness. It was unclear where soldiers could work. The marriage rate spiked during and immediately after the war. Soldiers didn\u2019t want toreturn to their mother\u2019s basement. They wanted to start a family, in their own home, with agood job, right away. This worried policymakers, especially since the Great Depression was still a recent memory,having ended just \ufb01ve years prior.In 1946 the Council of Economic Advisors delivered a report to President Truman warning of\u201ca full-scale depression some time in the next one to four years.\u201d", "They wrote in a separate 1947 memo, summarizing a meeting with Truman: We might be in some sort of recession period where we should have to be very sure of ourground as to whether recessionary forces might be in danger of getting out of hand \u2026There is a substantial prospect which should not be overlooked that a further decline mayincrease the danger of a downward spiral into depression conditions. This fear was exacerbated by the fact that exports couldn\u2019t be immediately relied upon forgrowth, as two of the largest economies\u2014Europe and Japan\u2014sat in ruins dealing withhumanitarian crises. And America itself was buried in more debt than ever before, limitingdirect government stimulus.So we did something about it. 2. Low interest rates and the intentional birth of the American consumer. The \ufb01rst thing we did to keep the economy a\ufb02oat after the war was keep interest rates low.This wasn\u2019t an easy decision, because when soldiers came home to a shortage ofeverything from clothes to cars it temporarily sent in\ufb02ation into double digits.The Federal Reserve was not politically independent before 1951.\u2077\u00b2 The president and theFed could coordinate policy. In 1942 the Fed announced it would keep short-term rates at0.38% to help \ufb01nance the", "war. Rates didn\u2019t budge a single basis point for the next sevenyears. Three-month Treasury yields stayed below 2% until the mid-1950s.The explicit reason for keeping rates down was to keep the cost of \ufb01nancing the equivalentof the $6 trillion we spent on the war low.But low rates also did something else for all the returning GIs. It made borrowing to buyhomes, cars, gadgets, and toys really cheap.Which, from a paranoid policymaker\u2019s perspective, was great. Consumption became anexplicit economic strategy in the years after World War II.An era of encouraging thrift and saving to fund the war quickly turned into an era ofactively promoting spending. Princeton historian Sheldon Garon writes: After 1945, America again diverged from patterns of savings promotion in Europe and EastAsia \u2026 Politicians, businessmen and labor leaders all encouraged Americans to spend tofoster economic growth.\u2077\u00b3 Two things fueled this push.One was the GI Bill, which o\ufb00ered unprecedented mortgage opportunities. Sixteen millionveterans could buy a home often with no money down, no interest in the \ufb01rst year, and\ufb01xed rates so low that monthly mortgage payments could be lower than a rental.", "The second was an explosion of consumer credit, enabled by the loosening of Depression-era regulations. The \ufb01rst credit card was introduced in 1950. Store credit, installmentcredit, personal loans, payday loans\u2014everything took o\ufb00. And interest on all debt, includingcredit cards, was tax deductible at the time.It tasted delicious. So we ate a lot of it. A simple story in a simple table: Household debt in the 1950s grew 1.5 times faster than it did during the 2000s debtsplurge. 3. Pent-up demand for stu\ufb00 fed by a credit boom and a hidden 1930sproductivity boom led to an economic boom. The 1930s were the hardest economic decade in American history. But there was a silverlining that took two decades to notice: By necessity, the Great Depression hadsupercharged resourcefulness, productivity, and innovation.We didn\u2019t pay that much attention to the productivity boom in the \u201930s, because everyonewas focused on how bad the economy was. We didn\u2019t pay attention to it in the \u201940s,because everyone was focused on the war.Then the 1950s came around and we suddenly realized, \u201cWow, we have some amazingnew inventions. And we\u2019re really good at making them.\u201dAppliances, cars, phones, air conditioning, electricity.It was nearly impossible to buy many household goods during the", "war, because factorieswere converted to make guns and ships. That created pent-up demand from GIs for stu\ufb00", "after the war ended. Married, eager to get on with life, and emboldened with new cheapconsumer credit, they went on a buying spree like the country had never seen.Frederick Lewis Allen writes in his book The Big Change: During these postwar years the farmer bought a new tractor, a corn picker, an electricmilking machine; in fact he and his neighbors, between them, assembled a formidablearray of farm machinery for their joint use. The farmer\u2019s wife got the shining white electricrefrigerator she had always longed for and never during the Great Depression had beenable to a\ufb00ord, and an up-to-date washing machine, and a deep-freeze unit. The suburbanfamily installed a dishwashing machine and invested in a power lawnmower. The cityfamily became customers of a laundromat and acquired a television set for the living room.The husband\u2019s o\ufb03ce was air-conditioned. And so on endlessly. It\u2019s hard to overstate how big this surge was.Commercial car and truck manufacturing virtually ceased from 1942 to 1945. Then 21million cars were sold from 1945 to 1949. Another 37 million were sold by 1955.Just under two million homes were built from 1940 to 1945. Then seven million were builtfrom 1945 to 1950. Another eight million were built by 1955.Pent-up", "demand for stu\ufb00, and our newfound ability to make stu\ufb00, created the jobs that putreturning GIs back to work. And they were good jobs, too. Mix that with consumer credit,and America\u2019s capacity for spending exploded.The Federal Reserve wrote to President Truman in 1951: \u201cBy 1950, total consumerexpenditures, together with residential construction, amounted to about 203 billion dollars,or in the neighborhood of 40 percent above the 1944 level.\u201d\u2077\u2074The answer to the question, \u201cWhat are all these GIs going to do after the war?\u201d was nowobvious. They were going to buy stu\ufb00, with money earned from their jobs making new stu\ufb00,helped by cheap borrowed money to buy even more stu\ufb00. 4. Gains are shared more equally than ever before. The de\ufb01ning characteristic of economics in the 1950s is that the country got rich bymaking the poor less poor.Average wages doubled from 1940 to 1948, then doubled again by 1963.And those gains focused on those who had been left behind for decades before. The gapbetween rich and poor narrowed by an extraordinary amount.Lewis Allen wrote in 1955: The enormous lead of the well-to-do in the economic race has been considerably reduced.", "It is the industrial workers who as a group have done best\u2014people such as a steelworker\u2019sfamily who used to live on $2,500 and now are getting $4,500, or the highly skilledmachine-tool operator\u2019s family who used to have $3,000 and now can spend an annual$5,500 or more.As for the top one percent, the really well-to-do and the rich, whom we might classify veryroughly indeed as the $16,000-and-over group, their share of the total national income,after taxes, had come down by 1945 from 13 percent to 7 percent. This was not a short-term trend. Real income for the bottom 20% of wage-earners grew bya nearly identical amount as the top 5% from 1950 to 1980.The equality went beyond wages.Women held jobs outside the home in record numbers. Their labor force participation ratewent from 31% after the war to 37% by 1955, and to 40% by 1965.Minorities gained, too. After the 1945 inauguration Eleanor Roosevelt wrote about anAfrican American reporter who told her: Do you realize what twelve years have done? If at the 1933 reception a number of coloredpeople had gone down the line and mixed with everyone else in the way they did today,every paper in the country would have reported", "it. We do not even think it is news and noneof us will mention it. Women and minority rights were still a fraction of what they are today. But the progresstoward equality in the late \u201940s and \u201950s was extraordinary.The leveling out of classes meant a leveling out of lifestyles. Normal people drove Chevys.Rich people drove Cadillacs. TV and radio equalized the entertainment and culture peopleenjoyed regardless of class. Mail-order catalogs equalized the clothes people wore and thegoods they bought regardless of where they lived. Harper\u2019s Magazine noted in 1957: The rich man smokes the same sort of cigarettes as the poor man, shaves with the samesort of razor, uses the same sort of telephone, vacuum cleaner, radio, and TV set, has thesame sort of lighting and heating equipment in his house, and so on inde\ufb01nitely. Thedi\ufb00erences between his automobile and the poor man\u2019s are minor. Essentially they havesimilar engines, similar \ufb01ttings. In the early years of the century there was a hierarchy ofautomobiles. Paul Graham wrote in 2016 about what something as simple as there only being three TVstations did to equalize culture: It\u2019s di\ufb03cult to imagine now, but every night tens of millions of families would sit downtogether", "in front of their TV set watching the same show, at the same time, as their next", "door neighbors. What happens now with the Super Bowl used to happen every night. Wewere literally in sync.\u2077\u2075 This was important. People measure their well-being against their peers. And for most ofthe 1945\u20131980 period, people had a lot of what looked like peers to compare themselvesto. Many people\u2014most people\u2014lived lives that were either equal or at least fathomable tothose around them. The idea that people\u2019s lives equalized as much as their incomes is animportant point of this story we\u2019ll come back to. 5. Debt rose tremendously. But so did incomes, so the impact wasn\u2019t a big deal. Household debt increased \ufb01vefold from 1947 to 1957 due to the combination of the newconsumption culture, new debt products, and interest rates subsidized by governmentprograms, and held low by the Federal Reserve.But income growth was so strong during this period that the impact on households wasn\u2019tsevere. And household debt was so low to begin with after the war. The Great Depressionwiped out a lot of it, and household spending was so curtailed during the war that debtaccumulation was restricted. So the growth in household debt-to-income from 1947\u20131957was manageable.Household debt-to-income today is just over 100%. Even after rising in the 1950s, 1960s,and 1970s, it", "stayed below 60%.Driving a lot of this debt boom was a surge in home ownership.The homeownership rate in 1900 was 47%. It stayed right about there for the next fourdecades. Then it took o\ufb00, hitting 53% by 1945 and 62% by 1970. A substantial portion ofthe population was now using debt that previous generations would not\u2014could not\u2014haveaccessed. And they were mostly OK with it.David Halberstam writes in his book The Fifties: They were con\ufb01dent in themselves and their futures in a way that [those] growing up inharder times found striking. They did not fear debt as their parents had \u2026 They di\ufb00eredfrom their parents not just in how much they made and what they owned but in their beliefthat the future had already arrived. As the \ufb01rst homeowners in their families, they broughta new excitement and pride with them to the store as they bought furniture or appliances\u2014in other times young couples might have exhibited such feelings as they bought clothes fortheir \ufb01rst baby. It was as if the very accomplishment of owning a home re\ufb02ected such animmense breakthrough that nothing was too good to buy for it. Now\u2019s a good time to connect a few things, as they\u2019ll become", "increasingly important: America is booming.", "It\u2019s booming together like never before. It\u2019s booming with debt that isn\u2019t a big deal at the time because it\u2019s still low relative toincome and there\u2019s a cultural acceptance that debt isn\u2019t a scary thing. 6. Things start cracking. 1973 was the \ufb01rst year where it became clear the economy was walking down a new path.The recession that began that year brought unemployment to the highest it had been sincethe 1930s.In\ufb02ation surged. But unlike the post-war spikes, it stayed high.Short-term interest rates hit 8% in 1973, up from 2.5% a decade earlier.And you have to put all of that in the context of how much fear there was betweenVietnam, riots, and the assassinations of Martin Luther King, and John and Bobby Kennedy.It got bleak.America dominated the world economy in the two decades after the war. Many of thelargest countries had their manufacturing capacity bombed into rubble. But as the 1970semerged, that changed. Japan was booming. China\u2019s economy was opening up. The MiddleEast was \ufb02exing its oil muscles.A combination of lucky economic advantages and a culture shared by the GreatestGeneration\u2014hardened by the Depression and anchored in systematic cooperation from thewar\u2014shifted when Baby Boomers began coming of age. A new generation that", "had adi\ufb00erent view of what\u2019s normal hit at the same time a lot of the economic tailwinds of theprevious two decades ended.Everything in \ufb01nance is data within the context of expectations. One of the biggest shifts ofthe last century happened when the economic winds began blowing in a di\ufb00erent, unevendirection, but people\u2019s expectations were still rooted in a post-war culture of equality. Notnecessarily equality of income, although there was that. But equality in lifestyle andconsumption expectations; the idea that someone earning a 50th percentile incomeshouldn\u2019t live a life dramatically di\ufb00erent than someone in the 80th or 90th percentile. Andthat someone in the 99th percentile lived a better life, but still a life that someone in the50th percentile could comprehend. That\u2019s how America worked for most of the 1945\u20131980period. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you think that\u2019s morally right or wrong. It just mattersthat it happened.Expectations always move slower than facts. And the economic facts of the years betweenthe early 1970s through the early 2000s were that growth continued, but became moreuneven, yet people\u2019s expectations of how their lifestyle should compare to their peers didnot change.", "7. The boom resumes, but it\u2019s di\ufb00erent than before. Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 \u201cMorning in America\u201d ad declared: It\u2019s morning again in America. Today more men and women will go to work than everbefore in our country\u2019s history. With interest rates at about half the record highs of 1980,nearly 2,000 families today will buy new homes, more than at any time in the past fouryears. This afternoon 6,500 young men and women will be married, and with in\ufb02ation atless than half of what it was just four years ago, they can look forward with con\ufb01dence tothe future. That wasn\u2019t hyperbole. GDP growth was the highest it had been since the 1950s. By 1989there were six million fewer unemployed Americans than there were seven years before.The S&P 500 rose almost fourfold between 1982 and 1990. Total real GDP growth in the1990s was roughly equal to that of the 1950s\u201440% vs. 42%.President Clinton boasted in his 2000 State of the Union speech: We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs; the fastest economic growth inmore than 30 years; the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years; the lowest poverty rates in20 years; the lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record;", "the\ufb01rst back-to-back surpluses in 42 years; and next month, America will achieve the longestperiod of economic growth in our entire history. We have built a new economy. His last sentence was important. It was a new economy. The biggest di\ufb00erence between theeconomy of the 1945\u20131973 period and that of the 1982\u20132000 period was that the sameamount of growth found its way into totally di\ufb00erent pockets.You\u2019ve probably heard these numbers but they\u2019re worth rehashing. The Atlantic writes: Between 1993 and 2012, the top 1 percent saw their incomes grow 86.1 percent, while thebottom 99 percent saw just 6.6 percent growth. Joseph Stiglitz in 2011: While the top 1 percent have seen their incomes rise 18 percent over the past decade,those in the middle have actually seen their incomes fall. For men with only high-schooldegrees, the decline has been precipitous\u201412 percent in the last quarter-century alone. It was nearly the opposite of the \ufb02attening that occurred after the war.", "Why this happened is one of the nastiest debates in economics, topped only by the debateover what we should do about it. Lucky for the purpose of this discussion, neither matters.All that matters is that sharp inequality became a force over the last 35 years, and ithappened during a period where, culturally, Americans held onto two ideas rooted in thepost-WW2 economy: That you should live a lifestyle similar to most other Americans, andthat taking on debt to \ufb01nance that lifestyle is acceptable. 8. The big stretch. Rising incomes among a small group of Americans led to that group breaking away inlifestyle.They bought bigger homes, nicer cars, went to expensive schools, and took fancy vacations.And everyone else was watching\u2014fueled by Madison Avenue in the \u201980s and \u201990s, and theinternet after that.The lifestyles of a small portion of legitimately rich Americans in\ufb02ated the aspirations of themajority of Americans, whose incomes weren\u2019t rising.A culture of equality and togetherness that came out of the 1950s\u20131970s innocentlymorphs into a Keeping Up With The Joneses e\ufb00ect.Now you can see the problem.Joe, an investment banker making $900,000 a year, buys a 4,000 square foot house withtwo Mercedes and sends three of his kids to Pepperdine. He can", "a\ufb00ord it.Peter, a bank branch manager making $80,000 a year, sees Joe and feels a subconscioussense of entitlement to live a similar lifestyle, because Peter\u2019s parents believed\u2014andinstilled in him\u2014that Americans\u2019 lifestyles weren\u2019t that di\ufb00erent even if they had di\ufb00erentjobs. His parents were right during their era, because incomes fell into a tight distribution.But that was then. Peter lives in a di\ufb00erent world. But his expectations haven\u2019t changedmuch from his parents\u2019, even if the facts have.So what does Peter do?He takes out a huge mortgage. He has $45,000 of credit card debt. He leases two cars. Hiskids will graduate with heavy student loans. He can\u2019t a\ufb00ord the stu\ufb00 Joe can, but he\u2019spushed to stretch for the same lifestyle. It is a big stretch.This would have seemed preposterous to someone in the 1930s. But we\u2019ve spent 75 yearssince the end of the war fostering a cultural acceptance of household debt.During a time when median wages were \ufb02at, the median new American home grew 50%larger.", "The average new American home now has more bathrooms than occupants. Nearly halfhave four or more bedrooms, up from 18% in 1983.The average car loan adjusted for in\ufb02ation more than doubled between 1975 and 2003,from $12,300 to $27,900.And you know what happened to college costs and student loans.Household debt-to-income stayed about \ufb02at from 1963 to 1973. Then it climbed, andclimbed, and climbed, from around 60% in 1973 to more than 130% by 2007.Even as interest rates plunged from the early 1980s through 2020, the percentage ofincome going to debt service payments rose. And it skewed toward lower-income groups.The share of income going toward debt and lease payments is just over 8% for the highestincome groups\u2014those with the biggest income gains\u2014but over 21% for those below the50th percentile.The di\ufb00erence between this climbing debt and the debt increase that took place during the1950s and \u201960s is that the recent jump started from a high base.Economist Hyman Minsky described the beginning of debt crises: The moment whenpeople take on more debt than they can service. It\u2019s an ugly, painful moment. It\u2019s like WileE. Coyote looking down, realizing he\u2019s screwed, and falling precipitously.Which, of course, is what happened in 2008. 9. Once a paradigm", "is in place it is very hard to turn it around. A lot of debt was shed after 2008. And then interest rates plunged. Household debtpayments as a percentage of income are now at the lowest levels in 35 years.", "But the response to 2008, necessary as it may have been, perpetuated some of the trendsthat got us here.Quantitative easing both prevented economic collapse and boosted asset prices, a boon forthose who owned them\u2014mostly rich people.The Fed backstopped corporate debt in 2008. That helped those who owned that debt\u2014mostly rich people.Tax cuts over the last 20 years have predominantly gone to those with higher incomes.People with higher incomes send their kids to the best colleges. Those kids can go on toearn higher incomes and invest in corporate debt that will be backstopped by the Fed, ownstocks that will be supported by various government policies, and so on.None of these things are problems in and of themselves, which is why they stay in place.But they\u2019re symptomatic of the bigger thing that\u2019s happened since the early 1980s: Theeconomy works better for some people than others. Success isn\u2019t as meritocratic as it usedto be and, when success is granted, it\u2019s rewarded with higher gains than in previous eras.You don\u2019t have to think that\u2019s morally right or wrong.And, again, in this story it doesn\u2019t matter why it happened.It just matters that it did happen, and it caused the economy to shift away from people\u2019sexpectations", "that were set after the war: That there\u2019s a broad middle class withoutsystematic inequality, where your neighbors next door and a few miles down the road live alife that\u2019s pretty similar to yours.Part of the reason these expectations have stuck around for 35 years after they shifted awayfrom reality is because they felt so good for so many people when they were valid.Something that good\u2014or at least the impression that it was that good\u2014isn\u2019t easy to let goof.So people haven\u2019t let go of it. They want it back. 10. The Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, Brexit, and Donald Trump eachrepresents a group shouting, \u201cStop the ride, I want o\ufb00.\u201d The details of their shouting are di\ufb00erent, but they\u2019re all shouting\u2014at least in part\u2014because stu\ufb00 isn\u2019t working for them within the context of the post-war expectation thatstu\ufb00 should work roughly the same for roughly everyone.You can sco\ufb00 at linking the rise of Trump to income inequality alone. And you should. Thesethings are always layers of complexity deep. But it\u2019s a key part of what drives people tothink, \u201cI don\u2019t live in the world I expected. That pisses me o\ufb00. So screw this. And screw you!I\u2019m going to \ufb01ght for something totally", "di\ufb00erent, because this\u2014whatever it is\u2014isn\u2019tworking.\u201dTake that mentality and raise it to the power of Facebook, Instagram, and cable news\u2014where people are more keenly aware of how other people live than ever before. It\u2019s gasolineon a \ufb02ame. Benedict Evans says, \u201cThe more the Internet exposes people to new points ofview, the angrier people get that di\ufb00erent views exist.\u201d That\u2019s a big shift from the post-war", "economy where the range of economic opinions were smaller, both because the actualrange of outcomes was lower and because it wasn\u2019t as easy to see and learn what otherpeople thought and how they lived.I\u2019m not pessimistic. Economics is the story of cycles. Things come, things go.The unemployment rate is now the lowest it\u2019s been in decades. Wages are now actuallygrowing faster for low-income workers than the rich.\u2077\u2076 College costs by and large stoppedgrowing once grants are factored in.\u2077\u2077 If everyone studied advances in health care,communication, transportation, and civil rights since the Glorious 1950s, my guess is mostwouldn\u2019t want to go back.But a central theme of this story is that expectations move slower than reality on theground. That was true when people clung to 1950s expectations as the economy changedover the next 35 years. And even if a middle-class boom began today, expectations that theodds are stacked against everyone but those at the top may stick around.So the era of \u201cThis isn\u2019t working\u201d may stick around.And the era of \u201cWe need something radically new, right now, whatever it is\u201d may stickaround.Which, in a way, is part of what starts events that led to things like World War II, where thisstory began.History", "is just one damned thing after another."]}}
