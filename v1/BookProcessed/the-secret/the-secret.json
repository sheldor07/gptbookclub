BOB DOYL E The law of attraction doesn' t care whethe r you perceive something to be good or bad, or whethe r you don't want it or whethe r you do want it. It's res-ponding to your thoughts. So if you're looking at a mountain of debt, feeling terrible about it, that's the signal you're putting out into the Universe. \"I feel really bad because of all this debt I've got.\" You're just affirming it to yourself. You feel it on every level of your being. That's what you're going to get more of. The law of attractio n is a law of nature . It is impersona l and it does not see goo d thing s or bad t h i n g s .

When you focus on the things that you don't want \u2014 \"I don't want to be late, I don't want to be late\"\u2014the law of attraction doesn't hear that you don't want it.

At night, what do I do? I empty my pocket, and there it is again. I've had some amazing experiences with this idea. A guy from South Africa saw me drop it. He asked, \"What is that?\" I explained it to him, and he started calling it a gratitude rock. Two weeks later I got an email from him, in South Africa. And he said, \"My son is dying from a rare disease. It's a type of hepatitis. Would you send me three gratitude rocks?\" They were just ordinary rocks I found off the street, so I said, \"Sure.\" I had to make sure that the rocks were very special, so I went out to the stream, picked out the right rocks, and sent them off to him. Four or five months later I get an email from him. He said, \"My son's better, he's doing terrific.\" And he said, \"But you need to know something. We've sold", "over a thousand rocks at ten dollars apiece as gratitude rocks, and we've raised all this money for charity. Thank you very much.\" So it's very important to have an \"attitude of gratitude.\" The grea t scientis t Alber t Einstei n revolutionize d the way we view time, space , and gravity .

JOH N ASSARA F Knowing the law of attraction, I wante d to really put it to use and to see what would happen. In 1995 I started to create something called a Vision Board, where I take something that", "The Secre t I want to achieve, or something that I want to attract, like a car or a watch or the soul mate of my dreams, and I put a picture of what I want up on this board. Every day I would sit in my office and I would look up at this board and I would start to visualize. I would really get into the state of having already acquired it. I was getting ready to move. We put all the furniture, all the boxes, into storage, and I made three different moves over a period of five years. And then I ended up in California and bought this house, renovated it for a year, and then had all the stuff brought from my farmer home five years earlier. One morning my son Keenan came into my office, and one of the boxes that was sealed for five years was right at the doorstep. He asked, \"What's in the boxes, Daddy?\" And I said, \"Those are my Vision Boards/' He then asked, \"What's a Vision Board?\" I said, \"Well, it's where I put alt my goals up. I cut them out and I put all my goals", "up as something that I want to achieve in my life.\" Of course at five and a half years old he didn't understand, and so I said, \"Sweetheart, let me just show you, that'll be the easiest way to do it.\" I cut the box open, and on one Vision Board was a picture of a home that I was visualizing five years earlier. What was shocking was that we were living in that house. Not a house like it\u2014I actually bought my dream home, renovated it, and didn't even know it. I looked at that house and I started to cry, because I was just blown away. Keenan asked, \"Why are you crying?\" \"I finally understand how the law of attraction", "Powerfu l P r o c e s s e s 9 1 works. I finally understand the power of visualization. I finally understand everything that I've read, everything that I've worked with my whole life, the way I've built companies.

Believe you deserve it and believe it's possible for you. And then close your eyes every day for several minutes, and visualize having what you already want, feeling the feelings of already having it. Come out of that and focus on what you're grateful for already, and really enjoy it. Then go into your day and release it to the Universe and trust that the Universe will figure out how to manifest it.", "Expectation is a powerful attractive force. Expect the things you want, and don't expect the things you don't want. Gratitude is a powerful process for shifting your energy and bring - ing more of what you want into your life. Be grateful for what you already have, and you will attract more good things. Giving thanks for what you want in advance turbo-charges your desires and sends a more powerful signal out into the Universe. Visualization is the process of creating pictures in your mind of yourself enjoying what you want. When you visualize, you gener - ate powerful thoughts and feelings of having it now. The law of at- traction then returns that reality to you, just as you saw it in your mind. To use the law of attraction to your advantage, make it a habitual way of being, not just a one-time event. At the end of every day, before you go to sleep, go back through the events of the day. Any events or moments that were not what you wanted, replay them in your mind the way you wanted them to go. 93", "\"Whateve r the min d ... can conceiv e it can achieve. \" JACK CANFIEL D The Secret was a real transformation for me, because I grew up with a very negative father who thought that rich people were people that had ripped everyone off and thought that anyone that had money must have deceived somebody. So I grew up with a lot of beliefs about money; that if you had it, it made you bad, only evil people have money, and money doesn't grow on trees. \"Who do you think I am, Rockefeller?' That was one of his favorite phrases. So I grew up truly believing that life was difficult. It was only when I met W. Clement Stone that I began to shift my life. 95"]}, "chapter 6": {"name": "The secret to money", "text": ["96 T h e Secre t When I was workin g with Stone he said, \"I want you to set a goal that's so big that if you achieved it, it would blow your mind, and you woul d knew it's only because of what I've taught you that you would have achieved this goal\" At the time I was making about eight thousand dollars a year, so I said, \"I want to make a hundred thousand dollars in a year.\" Now, I had no idea how I could do that. I saw no strategy, no possibility, but I just said, \"I'm going to declare that, I'm going to believe it, I'm going to act as if it's true, and release it\" So I did that. One of the things he taught me was every day to close your eyes and visualize the goals as if it's already achieved. I had actually made a hundred-thousand-dollar bill that I'd put on the ceiling. So first thing in the morning I'd look up and there it was, and it would remind me that this was my intention. Then I woul d close my eyes and visualize having this hundred- thousand-dollar-a-year lifestyle. Interestingly", "enough, nothing major happened for about thirty days. I didn't have any great breakthrough ideas, no one was offering me more money. About four weeks into it, I had a hundred-thousand-dollar idea. It just came right into my head. I had a book I had written, and I said, \"If I can sell four hundred thousand copies of my book at a quarter each, that'd be a hundred thousand dollars.\" Now, the book was there, but I never had this thought. (One of The Secrets is that when you have an inspired thought, you have to trust it and act on it.) I didn't know how I was going to sell four hundred thousand copies.", "The Secre t to Mone y Then I saw the Nationa l Enquire r at the supermarket. I had seen that millions of times and it was just background. And all of a sudden it jumped out at me as foreground. I thought, \"If readers knew about my book, certainly four hundred thousand people would go out and buy it.\" About six weeks later I gave a talk at Hunter College in New York to six hundred teachers, and afterward a woman approached me and said, \"That was a great talk. I want to interview you. Let me give you my card.\" As it turns out, she was a freelance writer who sold her stories to the Nationa l Enquirer . The theme from \"The Twilight Zone\" went off in my head, like, whoah, this stuff's really working. That article came out and our book sales started to take off. The point I want to make is that I was attracting into my life all these different events, including this person. To make a long story short, I did not make a hundred thousand dollars that year. We made ninety-two thousand three hundred and twenty-seven dollars. But do you think", "we were depressed and saying, \"This doesn't work\"? No, we were saying, \"This is amazing!\" So my wife said to me, \"If it works for a hundred thousand, do you think it'd work for a million ?\" And I said, \"I don't know, I think so. Let's try it.\" My publisher wrote me a royalty check for our first Chicke n Soup for the Soul book. And he actually put a smiley face in his signature, because it was the first million-dollar check he'd ever written.", "98 T h e Secre t So I know from my own experience, became I wanted to test it Does this Secret really work?

That the Universe essentially emerges from thought and all of this matter around us is just precipitated thought. Ultimately toe are the source of the Universe, and when we understand that power directly by experience, we can start to exercise our authority and begin to achieve more and more. Create anything. Know anything from within the field of our own consciousness, which ultimately is Universal consciousness that runs the Universe. So depending upon how we use that power, positively or negatively, that's the kind of body in terms of health, that's the kind of environment we create. So we are the creators, not only of our own destiny, but ultimately we are the creators of Universal destiny. We are the creators of the Universe. So there's no limit, really, to human potential.
