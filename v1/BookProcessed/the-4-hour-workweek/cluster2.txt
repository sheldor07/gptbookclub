## Key Idea: Understanding the Importance of Relative Income

# Introduction

In economics, income is typically measured in terms of absolute income, which is the total amount of money earned. However, the concept of relative income, which takes into account the amount of money earned per unit of time worked, is gaining more attention. Relative income considers both the total absolute income and the amount of time invested to earn that income. 

# Comparing Absolute Income and Relative Income

Let's consider an example to understand the difference between absolute income and relative income. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year by working 80 hours per week for 50 weeks. The total absolute income she earns is $100,000. On the other hand, John Doe makes $50,000 per year by working only 10 hours per week for 50 weeks. While John's total absolute income is half of Jane's, when we analyze relative income, it tells a different story. Jane makes $25 per hour, while John makes $100 per hour. In terms of relative income, John is actually four times richer than Jane. 

# Importance of Relative Income

When it comes to measuring wealth accurately, relative income takes precedence over absolute income. Relative income considers the relationship between the amount earned and the time invested. For example, if someone makes $100 per hour but only works one hour per week, it would be challenging for them to live luxuriously. They may not have enough time to enjoy the fruits of their labor and fulfill their aspirations. Therefore, the goal is to ensure that relative income is at a level where one can effectively pursue their dreams and live the life they desire. 

# The Concept of the New Rich

The New Rich, a term coined by author Tim Ferriss, refers to a group of individuals who have achieved financial independence by focusing on relative income rather than absolute income. These individuals aim for higher hourly rates while reducing the number of hours worked. The top New Rich individuals set their target at making at least $5,000 per hour. 

# Pursuing Higher Relative Income

For many individuals, starting off with a low hourly rate is a common experience. Out of college, for example, someone may earn only $5 per hour. However, the aim should always be to progress towards higher relative income. By focusing on increasing the hourly rate, individuals can move closer to the financial freedom enjoyed by the top New Rich. 

# Distress vs. Eustress

Another key aspect of pursuing financial independence through relative income is understanding the impact of distress and eustress. Distress refers to negative stress, which can be brought on by financial worries, long working hours, and other factors that lead to dissatisfaction. On the other hand, eustress refers to positive stress, which arises from challenging and fulfilling activities. 

# Conclusion

Understanding the importance of relative income can revolutionize the way we approach wealth and financial independence. By focusing on the relationship between income earned and time invested, we can aim for higher relative income and achieve our dreams. The New Rich concept offers insights into this approach, encouraging individuals to seek higher hourly rates and reduce unnecessary working hours.
