## Winning through Strategy and Technicality

In this story, the key idea revolves around the narrator's success in a fighting competition by utilizing strategic approaches and exploiting a specific technicality. Despite not possessing exceptional fighting skills, the narrator managed to win by employing two key strategies.

The first strategy involved manipulating their weight to their advantage. By utilizing dehydration techniques commonly practiced by elite powerlifters and Olympic wrestlers, the narrator succeeded in losing 28 pounds in just 18 hours. This allowed them to weigh in at a lower weight class, giving them an advantage against their opponents.

The second strategy was based on the rules of the competition. The fine print stated that if a combatant fell off the elevated platform three times in a single round, their opponent would win by default. Recognizing this technicality, the narrator decided to make it their principal technique and focused on pushing their opponents off the platform. This unique approach was successful in securing victories, although it didn't sit well with the judges.

As a result of their unconventional tactics, the narrator won all of their matches, but at the same time, they lost a significant number of friends. This outcome highlights the potential consequences of using strategies that deviate from the traditional norms of the competition.
