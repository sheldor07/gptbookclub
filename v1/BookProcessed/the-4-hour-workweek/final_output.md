## Key Idea: Advantages and Disadvantages of Renting the Ballroom for Lectures

### Advantages:

"Ballroom-free." By renting out the ballroom for lectures and conventions, you will have the advantage of not having to pay for its use. This means that any revenue generated from events held in the ballroom will be profit for you. Dances and conventions, in particular, have the potential to generate significantly higher income compared to a series of lectures.

### Disadvantages:

Firstly, renting out the ballroom for lectures might actually decrease your income rather than increasing it. The rent you are asking for may be unaffordable for the speaker, resulting in them choosing an alternative venue for their lectures.

Another disadvantage to consider is that these lectures attract educated and cultured individuals to your hotel. This serves as excellent advertising for your establishment. In fact, the number of people attracted to your hotel through these lectures far surpasses what a five-thousand-dollar newspaper advertisement would bring in. The visibility and reputation gained from hosting such lectures are valuable assets for your business.

## Key Idea: Lack of appreciation for a child's gestures of love and effort.

### Text:

Your shoes," I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor. At breakfast, I found fault too; you spilled things, gulped down your food, put your elbows on the table, and spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, "Goodbye, Daddy!" I frowned and said in reply, "Hold your shoulders back!"

Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road, I spied you down on your knees playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive, and if you had to buy them, you would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father!

Do you remember later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door. "What is it you want?" I snapped. You said nothing but stood there holding something behind your back. "What is it you have in your hand?" I demanded.

The words tumbled out: "With a quivering voice, "Here, Daddy, it's a little wooden box, I made it for you."

## The Power of Constructive Criticism

Throughout history, people have realized the influence and consequences of criticism, whether positive or negative. From the caveman chiseling his opinions on walls to the eloquent debates of ancient Greeks, the way criticism is expressed can have a lasting impact. Shakespeare even advised to approach criticism indirectly, recognizing that direct criticism often backfires. It is easy to find fault and complain, but true character is displayed through understanding, forgiveness, and how one treats others, regardless of their stature.

## Key Idea: Lincoln's disappointment with General Meade's failure to capture Lee

In this letter written by President Lincoln to General Meade in 1863, we see Lincoln expressing his bitter disappointment and frustration over the failure to capture General Lee. Lincoln felt that victory was within their grasp and believes that if Meade had acted, the war could have ended. 

The letter starts with Lincoln expressing his frustration, as he wonders why the army did not seize the opportunity to defeat the enemy. He reflects on how simple it would have been to overcome Lee and feels that any general could have achieved victory under the circumstances. Lincoln even goes as far as saying that if he had been there, he could have defeated Lee himself.

It is important to note that during this period, Lincoln was known for being conservative and restrained in his language. So, this letter carries great significance, as it can be seen as a severe reprimand coming from him. Lincoln emphasizes in the letter that Meade does not seem to grasp the magnitude of the misfortune caused by Lee's escape. 

According to Lincoln, capturing Lee would have been a game-changing moment in the war. He believed that by closing in on him, it would have led to the end of the war, especially when considering the recent successes they had achieved. Lincoln felt that Meade's inaction had prolonged the war indefinitely. 

Lincoln questions Meade's ability to successfully attack Lee south of the river, highlighting the fact that they would only have a fraction of the force they had during the previous opportunity. He urges Meade not to waste any time attempting to do so, as it would be unreasonable to expect success with such limited resources. 

Overall, Lincoln's letter showcases his disappointment and frustration with General Meade's failure to capture Lee. He believed that it was a missed opportunity that could have led to the end of the war. Lincoln's words in this letter were severe, given his usual conservative language, highlighting the gravity of the situation in his eyes.

## The Importance of Nourishing Self-Esteem and Appreciation

Alfred Lunt, a renowned actor, once mentioned how he tried fasting for six days and nights as a fad. Surprisingly, it wasn't a challenging task, and he felt less hungry by the sixth day, compared to the second. However, it's strange that while we won't allow our loved ones or workers to go hungry for even a day, we sometimes neglect to appreciate them for weeks, months, or even years.

This attitude can leave them wanting hearty, positive feedback, almost as much as they crave food. Alfred Lunt, during his leading role in Reunion in Vienna, commented on his need for self-esteem nourishment, saying, "There is nothing I need so much as nourishment for my self-esteem." While we may provide food to those in our care, we often forget to offer kind words of appreciation that can create everlasting memories. These words can be like the music of the morning stars, singing in their hearts for years to come.

In one of his radio broadcasts, "The Rest of the Story," Paul Harvey also pointed out this crucial aspect of human interaction. It's important to nourish not only our physical bodies but also the self-esteem and emotional well-being of others. This simple act of appreciation can have a profound impact on individuals and relationships.

We live in a world where the pace of life can often make us forget to acknowledge and appreciate the people around us. We get so caught up in the hustle and bustle that we neglect to recognize and value the efforts, contributions, and presence of others. We take people for granted, assuming that they know how much we appreciate them. However, this assumption can be detrimental to relationships, causing feelings of neglect and diminish self-esteem.

We often fail to realize that a few kind words can go a long way in nourishing someone's self-esteem. Just as food provides sustenance and energy to our bodies, appreciation acts as fuel for the soul. It uplifts spirits, boosts confidence, and creates a sense of validation and belonging.

Think about it - when was the last time someone genuinely expressed their appreciation for something you did? How did it make you feel? Chances are, even a small act of acknowledgment brought a smile to your face and made you feel valued. The same goes for others. When we take the time to appreciate and acknowledge the efforts of those around us, we not only make them feel seen and heard, but we also strengthen the bonds of our relationships.

Appreciation is not just a one-time gesture; it should be an ongoing practice. It's essential to show our gratitude consistently, giving sincere compliments and recognition regularly. By doing so, we create an environment where people feel valued and motivated to continue their efforts.

Sometimes, we may hesitate to express our appreciation, thinking that it might seem corny or insincere. But just as genuine hunger cannot be satisfied with imaginary food, true self-esteem and emotional nourishment cannot be achieved with empty words.

Therefore, the key lies in being authentic in our expressions of appreciation. Take the time to genuinely observe and recognize the qualities and actions of those around you. Instead of generic compliments, provide specific and meaningful feedback that acknowledges their unique contributions. A heartfelt "thank you" or a thoughtful note can go much further than a generic pat on the back.

In a world that often prioritizes productivity and tangible achievements, it's easy to overlook the power of appreciation. However, cultivating a culture of appreciation can transform relationships, boost morale, and create a positive atmosphere. When we nourish the self-esteem of others through our words and actions, we contribute to their overall well-being and happiness.

So, let's make a conscious effort to prioritize appreciation and nourishment of self-esteem in our interactions with others. Remember, just as food is essential for our physical health, acknowledgment and appreciation are vital for the emotional and psychological well-being of those around us. Together, let's create a world where everyone feels appreciated, valued, and truly seen for who they are and what they bring to our lives.

## Key Idea: The Desire for Importance: What It Drives and Reveals about Us

### The Creative Impetus

The desire for a feeling of importance has spurred great authors like Charles Dickens to write timeless novels. Dickens, motivated by this desire, crafted narratives that resonated with readers for generations to come. Similarly, the renowned architect Sir Christopher Wren sought to design awe-inspiring structures that would leave a lasting impact. This same desire to create something significant drove Wren to construct magnificent buildings that still stand as symphonies in stone.

### The Pursuit of Wealth

The desire for importance can manifest in the pursuit of material wealth, leading to unprecedented accumulation of resources. Look no further than the example of John D. Rockefeller, who amassed millions of dollars that he never even spent. It was this desire for a feeling of importance that propelled him to such astronomical financial success. Furthermore, even in our own towns, we may find families building houses far larger than necessary in an attempt to display their status and importance.

### Influence on Lifestyle Choices

The desire for feeling important often influences our choice of lifestyle. We may find ourselves drawn to the latest fashion trends, eagerly seeking to wear the most current styles. The same desire can extend to our choice of vehicles, as we strive to drive the latest cars to demonstrate our importance. Additionally, parents may become captivated by sharing their children's achievements, reflecting their own sense of importance through their brilliant offspring.

### The Dark Side

Unfortunately, the desire for importance can also lead to negative consequences. For some, this desire becomes a driving force for negative behavior, drawing them towards criminal activities. E. P. Mulrooney, former police commissioner of New York, has noted that many young criminals are motivated by ego. Their first request after arrest is often for newspapers that depict them as larger-than-life figures, like the sports stars, actors, and politicians they admire. This desire for a distorted sense of importance propels them into criminal activities, overshadowing the consequences they may face.

### The Key to Character

In understanding how we seek our feeling of importance, we can discern significant aspects of our character. The magnitude of this desire and what we prioritize in its pursuit reveal much about who we are as individuals. It is not our possessions or accomplishments that define us, but rather the underlying motivations and values that drive our quest for importance.

In summary, the desire for a feeling of importance is a powerful force that shapes our lives in various ways. It drives creativity and the pursuit of wealth, influences our lifestyle choices, and unfortunately, can lead some astray. Understanding this desire and what it reveals about our character enables us to navigate our lives with greater self-awareness, focusing on what truly matters to us as individuals.
