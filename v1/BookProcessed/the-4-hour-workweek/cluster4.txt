## Key Idea: Addressing customer complaints and handling them professionally 

As a business owner, it is important to address customer complaints and handle them professionally. While it may be tempting to respond with anger or frustration, a more effective approach is to apologize and find a solution. In this scenario, the customer is upset about a late delivery, but instead of retaliating, the business owner acknowledges the mistake and apologizes.
