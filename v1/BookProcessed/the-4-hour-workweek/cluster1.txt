# Prioritizing Over Technology In Corporate America

You don't really need or fuss with your BlackBerry for a few hours when you should be prioritizing. In fact, if you want to move up the ladder in most of corporate America (and assuming they donâ€™t really check what you are doing - let's be honest), just run around.

## Focus on Prioritizing

In the fast-paced world of corporate America, it's easy to get caught up in the constant stream of information and technology. However, if you want to succeed and move up the ladder, it's crucial to prioritize your tasks. Instead of spending hours on your BlackBerry or other devices, focus on identifying the most important tasks and dedicating your time and energy to them. By prioritizing effectively, you can ensure that you are working on the most impactful projects and making progress towards your goals.

## The Irrelevance of BlackBerry

Gone are the days when BlackBerry was considered an essential tool for professionals. In today's corporate America, the importance of this device has significantly diminished. Spending excessive time fussing over your BlackBerry is no longer a guarantee of productivity or success. Rather than being chained to your device, it's essential to recognize that true progress comes from focusing on your priorities and making meaningful contributions to your work.

## Progression in Corporate America

In most corporate settings, success is not solely determined by how much time you spend on your electronic devices. While some organizations may not closely monitor your every move, it's important to remember that true advancement comes from taking strategic actions. Simply running around and appearing busy will not impress your superiors or lead to career growth. Instead, prioritizing your tasks and consistently delivering high-quality results is what will set you apart and propel you towards success in the corporate world.

## Strategic Actions over Appearances

Contrary to popular belief, simply appearing busy does not equate to being productive or successful. Taking strategic actions and focusing on the most significant tasks will have a far greater impact on your career progression. Rather than worrying about what others think or how much time you spend on your device, shift your attention towards making strategic decisions and delivering tangible results. By doing so, you will demonstrate your value and contribute to the overall success of your organization.

## Embrace Efficient Time Management

Efficient time management is key to prioritizing effectively in corporate America. Rather than getting bogged down by the constant distractions of technology, it's important to allocate your time wisely. This means identifying your most critical tasks, allocating sufficient time for their completion, and minimizing unnecessary time spent on your BlackBerry or similar devices. By efficiently managing your time, you can ensure that you are dedicating your energy to the tasks that truly matter, accelerating your career progression.

## The Importance of Results

In the corporate world, the focus is ultimately on results. While technology can aid productivity and communication, it should not be the sole driver of your success. Managers and leaders value employees who consistently deliver high-quality results and contribute to the company's objectives. Therefore, prioritizing your tasks and dedicating your efforts to achieving meaningful outcomes will have a far greater impact on your career advancement than simply being tethered to your BlackBerry.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, in today's corporate America, it is vital to prioritize your tasks and focus on the most important aspects of your job. Fussing over your BlackBerry or similar devices for hours on end will not guarantee success or career progression. Instead, it's crucial to allocate your time and energy effectively, making strategic decisions and delivering tangible results. By embracing efficient time management and prioritizing tasks based on their impact, you can navigate the corporate world with confidence and achieve your goals.
