KENNEDY Some people remain convinced that just a bit more money will make things right. Their goals are arbitrary moving ta rgets: $300,000 in the bank, $1,000,000 in the portfolio, $100,000 a year instead of $50,000, etc. Julie\u2019s goal made intrinsic sense: come back with the same number of children she had left with.", "She reclined in her seat and glanced acr oss the aisle past he r sleeping husband, Marc, counting as she had done thousands of times\u2014one, two, three. So far so good. In 12 hours, they would all be back in Paris, safe and sound. That was assuming the plane from New Caledonia he ld together, of course. New Caledonia? Nestled in the tropics of the Coral Sea, New Caledonia was a French territory and where Julie and Marc had just sold the sailboat that took them 15,000 miles around the world. Of course, recouping thei r initial investment had been part of the plan. All said and done, their 15-month exploration of the globe, from the gondola-rich waterways of Venice to the tribal shores of Po lynesia, had cost between $18,000 and $19,000. Less than rent and baguettes in Paris. Most people would consider this impossi ble. Then again, most people don\u2019t know that more than 300 families set sail fro m France each year to do the same. The trip had been a dream for almost two decades, relegated to the back of the line behind an ever-growing list of responsibilities. Each passing moment brought a new list of", "reasons for putting it off. One day, Julie realized that if she didn\u2019t do it now, she would never do it. The rationaliz ations, legitimate or not, wo uld just continue to add up and make it harder to convince he rself that escape was possible. One year of preparation and one 30-day tr ial run with her husband later, they set sail on the trip of a lifetime. Ju lie realized almost as soon as the anchor lifted that, far from being a reason not to travel and seek adventure, children are perhaps the best reason of all to do both. Pre-trip, her three little boys had fought like banshees at the drop of a hat. In the process of learning to coexis t in a floating bedroom, they learned patience, as much for themselves as for the sanity of thei r parents. Pre-trip, books were about as appealing as eating sand. Give n the alternative of staring at a wall on the open sea, all three learned to love books. Pulling them out of school for one academic year and exposing them to new environments had prove n to be the best investment in their education to date.", "Now sitting in the plane, Julie looked out at the clouds as the wing cut past them, already thinking of their next plans: to find a place in th e mountains and ski all year long, using income from a sail-rigging wo rkshop to fund the slopes and more travel.

God forbid. That seemed a bit dangerous, considering I did it on a dare and had f our weeks of preparation. Besides, I have a watermel on head\u2014it\u2019s a big target. I won by reading the rules and looking for unexploited opportunities, of which there were two: 1. Weigh-ins were the day prior to competition: U s i n g d e h y d r a t i o n t e c h n i q u e s commonly practiced by elite powerlifters and Olympic wres tlers, I lost 28 pounds in 18 hours, weighed in at 165 pounds, and th en hyperhydrated back to 193 pounds.2 It\u2019s hard to fight someone from three wei ght classes above you. Poor little guys. 2. There was a technicality in the fine print: If one combatant fell off the elevated platform three times in a single round, his opponent won by default. I decided to use this technicality as my principal technique and push people off. As you might imagine, this did not make the judges the happiest Chinese I\u2019ve ever seen. The result? I won all of my", "matches by technical knock-out (T KO) and went home national champion, something 99% of those with 5\u201310 years of experience had been unable to do. But, isn\u2019t pushing people out of the ri ng pushing the boundaries of ethics? Not at all\u2014it\u2019s no more than doing the uncommon with in the rules. The important distinction is that between official rule s and self-imposed rules. Consider the following example, from the official website of the Olympic movement ( www.olympic.org ). The 1968 Mexico City Olympics marked the international debut of Dick Fosbury and his celebrated \u201cFosbury flop,\u201d which would soon revolutionize high-jumping. At the time, jumpers\u2026 swung their outside foot up and over the bar [called the \u201cstraddle,\u201d much like a hurdle jump, it allowed you to land on your feet]. Fosbury\u2019s technique began by racing up to the bar at great speed and taking off from his right (or outside) foot. Then he twisted his body so that he went over the bar head-fir st with his back to the bar. While the coaches of the world shook their heads in disbelief, the Mexico City audience was absolutely captivated by Fosbur y and shouted, \u201cOl\u00e9!\u201d as he cleared the bar.", "Fosbury cleared every height th rough 2.22 metres without a miss and then achieved a personal record of 2.24 metres to win the gold medal. By 1980, 13 of the 16 Olympic finalists were using the Fosbury flop. The weight-cutting techniques and off-platform throwing I used are now standard features of Sanshou competition. I didn\u2019t cause it, I just foresaw it as inevitable, as did others who tested this superior a pproach. Now it\u2019s par for the course. Sports evolve when sacred cows are k illed, when basic assumptions are tested. The same is true in life and in lifestyles.", "Challenging the Status Quo vs. Being Stupid M ost people walk down the street on their legs. Does that mean I walk down the street on my hands? Do I wear my underwear outside of my pants in the name of being different? Not usually, no. Then agai n, walking on my legs and keeping my thong on the inside have worked just fine thus far. I don\u2019 t fix it if it isn\u2019t broken. Different is better when it is more effective or more fun. If everyone is defining a problem or solv ing it one way and the results are subpar, this is the time to ask, What if I did th e opposite? Don\u2019t follow a model that doesn\u2019t work.

When I was in data storage sales, my first gig out of college, I realized that most cold calls didn\u2019t get to the intended person for one reason: gateke epers.

From Japan to Monaco, from globetrotting single mothers to multimillionaire racecar drivers, the ba sic rules of successful NR a r e s u r p r i s i n g l y u n i f o r m a n d predictably divergent from what the rest of the world is doing. The following rules are the fundamental di fferentiators to keep in mind throughout this book. 1. Retirement Is Worst-Cas e-Scenario Insurance . Retirement planning is like life insurance. It should be viewed as nothing more than a hedge against the absolute worst-case s cenario: in this case , becoming physically incapable of working and needing a reservoir of capital to survive. Retirement as a goal or final redemption is flawed for at least three solid reasons: 1. It is predicated on the assumption that you dislike what you are doing during the most physically capable year s of your life. This is a nonstarter\u2014 nothing can justify that sacrifice. 2. Most people will never be able to re tire and maintain even a", "hotdogs-for- dinner standard of living. Even one million is chump change in a world where traditional retirement could span 30 year s and inflation lowers your purchasing power 2\u20134% per year. The math doesn\u2019t work.3The golden years become lower-middle-class life revisite d. That\u2019s a bittersweet ending. 3. If the math does work, it means that you are one ambitious, hardworking machine. If that\u2019s the ca se, guess what? One week into retirement, you\u2019ll be so damn bored that you\u2019ll want to stick bicycle spokes in your eyes. You\u2019ll probably opt to look for a new job or st art another company. Kinda defeats the purpose of waiting, doesn\u2019t it?", "I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t plan for the worst case\u2014I have maxed out 401(k)s and IRAs I use primarily for tax purposes\u2014but don\u2019t mistake retirement for the goal. 2. Interest and Energy Are Cyclical . If I offered you $10,000,000 to work 24 hours a day for 15 years and then retire, would you do it? Of cour se not\u2014you couldn\u2019t. It is unsus tainable, just as what most define as a career: doing the same thing for 8+ hours per day until you break down or have enough cash to permanently stop. How else can my 30-year-old friends a ll look like a cross between Donald Trump and Joan Rivers? It\u2019s horrendous\u2014prem ature aging fueled by triple bypass frappuccinos and impossible workloads. Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary to survive, let alone thrive. Capacity, interest, and mental enduran ce all wax and wane. Plan accordingly. The NR a im s t o d i s t r i b u t e \u201c m i n i - r e t i r e m e n t s\u201d throughout life instead of hoarding the recovery and enjoyment for the fool\u2019s gold of retirement. By working only when", "you are most effective, life is both more productive and more enjoyable. It\u2019s the perfect example of having your cake and eating it, too. Personally, I now aim for one month of overseas relocation or high-intensity learning (tango, fighting, whatever) for every two months of work projects. 3. Less Is Not Laziness . Doing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of greater personal importance, is NOT laziness. This is hard fo r most to accept, because our culture tends to reward personal sacrifice instead of personal productivity. Few people choose to (or are ab le to) measure the results of their actions and thus measure their contribution in time. More time equals more self-worth and more reinforcement from those above and around them. The NR, despite fewer hours in the office, produce more meaningful results than the next dozen non- NR combined. Let\u2019s define \u201claziness\u201d anew\u2014to endure a non-ideal existence, to let circumstance or others decide life for you, or to ama ss a fortune while passi ng through life like a spectator from an office window. The size of your bank account doesn\u2019t change this, nor does the number of hours you log in ha", "ndling unimportant e-mail or minutiae. Focus on being productive instead of busy. 4. The Timing Is Never Right . I once asked my mom how she decided when to have her first child, little ol\u2019 me. The answer was simple: \u201cIt was something we wanted, and we decided there was no point in putting it off. The timing is never right to have a baby.\u201d And so it is. For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never ali gn and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The univers e doesn\u2019t conspire against you, but it doesn\u2019t", "go out of its way to line up all the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. \u201cSomeday\u201d is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it\u2019s important to you and you want to do it \u201ceventually,\u201d just do it and correct course along the way. 5. Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission . If it isn\u2019t going to devast ate those around you, try it an d then justify it. People\u2014 whether parents, partners, or bosses\u2014deny th ings on an emotional basis that they can learn to accept after the fact. If the potential damage i s m o d e r a t e o r i n a n y w a y reversible, don\u2019t give people the chance to say no. Most pe ople are fast to stop you before you get started but hesitant to ge t in the way if you \u2019re moving. Get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up. 6. Emphasize Strengths, Don\u2019t Fix Weaknesses . Most people are good at a handful of things and utterly miserable at most. I am great at", "product creation and marketing but terribl e at most of the things that follow. My body is designed to lift heavy objects a nd throw them, and that\u2019s it. I ignored this for a long time. I tried swimming a nd looked like a drowning monkey. I tried basketball and looked like a caveman. Then I became a fighter and took off. It is far more lucrative and fun to levera ge your strengths inst ead of attempting to fix all the chinks in your armor. The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental i m p r o v e m e n t f i x i n g w e a k n e s s e s that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair. 7. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite . It is possible to have too much of a good thing. In excess, most endeavors and possessions take on the characteri stics of their opposite. Thus: Pacifists become militants. Freedom fighters become tyrants. Blessings become curses. Help becomes hindrance. More becomes less.4 Too much, too many, and too often of", "what you want becomes what you don\u2019t want. This is true of possessions and even time. Li festyle Design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle time, which is poisonous, but the positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed to what you feel obligated to do. 8. Money Alone Is Not the Solution . There is much to be said for the power of money as currency (I\u2019m a fan myself), but adding more of it just isn\u2019t the answer as often as we\u2019d like to think. In part, it\u2019s laziness. \u201cIf only I had more money\u201d is th e easiest way to postpone the intense self-", "examination and decision-making necessary to create a life of enjoyment\u2014now and not later. By using money as the scapegoat and work as our all-consuming routine, we are able to conveniently disall ow ourselves the time to do ot herwise: \u201cJohn, I\u2019d love to talk about the gaping void I f eel in my life, th e hopelessness that hits me like a punch in the eye every time I start my computer in the morni ng, but I have so much work to do! I\u2019ve got at least three hours of unimportant e-mail to reply to before calling the prospects who said \u2018no\u2019 yesterday. Gotta run!\u201d Busy yourself with the routin e of the money wheel, prete nd it\u2019s the fix-all, and you artfully create a constant distraction that prevents you from seeing just how pointless it is. Deep down, you know it\u2019s all an illusion, but with everyone participating in the same game of make-believe, it\u2019s easy to forget. The problem is more than money. 9. Relative Income Is More Impo rtant Than Absolute Income . Among dietitians and nutritionists, there is so me debate over the value of a calorie. Is a calorie a calorie, much like a", "rose is a rose? Is fat loss as simple as expending more calories than you consume, or is the s ource of those calories important? Based on work with top athletes, I know the answer to be the latter. What about income? Is a dollar is a dollar is a dollar? The New Rich don\u2019t think so. Let\u2019s look at this like a fifth-grade math problem. Two hardworking chaps are headed toward each other. Chap A movi ng at 80 hours per week and Chap B moving at 10 hours per week. They both make $50,000 per year. Who will be richer when they pass in the middle of the nigh t? If you said B, you would be correct, and this is the difference between absolute and relative income. Absolute income is measured using one holy and inalterable variable: the raw and almighty dollar. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year and is thus twice as rich as John Doe, who makes $50,000 per year. Relative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usually hours. The whole \u201cper year\u201d concept is arbitrary and makes it easy to trick yourse lf. Let\u2019s look at the real trade. Jane Doe makes", "$100,000 per y ear, $2,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, and works 80 hours per week. Jane Doe thus makes $25 per hour. John Doe makes $50,000 per year, $1,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, but works 10 hours per week and hence makes $100 per hour. In relative income, John is four times richer. Of course, relative income has to add up to the minimum amount necessary to actualize your goals. If I make $100 per hour but only work one hour per week, it\u2019s going to be hard for me to run amuck like a superstar. Assuming that the total absolute income is where it needs to be to live my dreams (not an arbitrary point of comparison with the Joneses), relative income is the re al measurement of wealth for the New Rich. The top New Rich mavericks make at least $5,000 per hour. Out of college, I started at about $5. I\u2019ll get you closer to the former. 10. Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good .", "Unbeknownst to most fun-loving bipeds, not all stress is bad. I ndeed, the New Rich don\u2019t aim to eliminate all stress. Not in th e least. There are two separate types of stress, each as different as euphor ia and its seldom-mentioned opposite, dysphoria. Distress refers to harmful stimuli that make you weaker, less confident, and less able. Destructive criticism, abusive bosse s, and smashing your face on a curb are examples of this. These are things we want to avoid. Eustress, on the other hand, is a word mo st of you have probably never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for \u201chealthy,\u201d is used in th e same sense in the word \u201ceuphoria.\u201d Role models who push us to exceed our limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of eustress\u2014stress that is healthfu l and the stimulus for growth. People who avoid all cr iticism fail. It\u2019s destructive criticism we need to avoid, not criticism in all forms. Similarly, there is no progress without eustress, and the more eustress we can create or apply to our liv es, the sooner we can actualize our dreams. The", "trick is telling the two apart. The New Rich are equally aggressive in removing distress and finding eustress. Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS 1.

At that time, I had more money than I knew what to do wit h\u2014I was making $70K or so per month\u2014and I was completely miserable, worse than ev er.

In other words, I was risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a probable and permanent 9 or 10, and I could easily recover my baseline workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I wanted to. This all equated to a significant realization: There was practically no risk, only huge life-changing upside potential , and I could resume my previous course without any more effo rt than I was already putting forth.

What would be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale of 1 \u201310? A r e t h e s e t h i n g s r e a l l y permanent? How likely do you think it is that they would actually happen? 2. What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back", "on the upswing, even if temporarily? Chances are, it\u2019s easier than you imagine. How could you get things back under control? 3. What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios? Now that you\u2019ve defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.) or external? What w ould the impact of these more-likely outcomes be on a scale of 1 \u201310? How likely is it that you could produce at least a moderately good outcome?

What is it costing you\u2014financial ly, emotionally, and physically\u2014to postpone action? Don\u2019t only evaluate the potentia l downside of action. It is equally important to meas ure the atrocious cost of inaction. If you don\u2019t pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five years, and ten years? How will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you and having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing what you know will not fulfill you?

But while the majority of undergraduates", "fill their time by updating their Fa cebook profiles or watching videos on YouTube, Marrinan wa s discussing Soto Zen Buddhism via e- mail with Randy Komisar, a partner at th e venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, and asking Google CEO Eric Schmidt via e-mail when he had been happiest in his life. (Schmidt\u2019s answer: \u201cTomorrow.\u201d) Prior to his e-mail, Marrinan had never c ontacted Komisar. He had met Schmidt, a Princeton University trustee, only briefly at an academic affairs meeting of the trustees in November. A self-described \u201cnaturally shy kid,\u201d Marrinan sa id he would never have dared to randomly e-mail two of the mo st powerful men in Silicon Valley if it weren\u2019t for Tim Ferriss, who offered a guest lecture in Professor Ed Zschau\u2019s \u201cHigh- Tech Entrepreneurship\u201d class. Ferriss cha llenged Marrinan and hi s fellow seniors to contact high-profile celebritie s and CEOs and get their answers to questions they have always wanted to ask. For extra incentive, Ferriss promised the student who could cont act the most hard- to-reach name and ask the most intriguing question a round-trip plane ticket anywhere in the world. \u201cI believe that success can be meas ured", "in the number of uncomfortable conversations you\u2019re willing to have.

Th at can only come after at least three or four genuine e-mail exchanges.\u201d With \u201ctextbook execution of the Tim Ferriss Technique,\u201d as he put it, Marrinan was able to strike up a bond with Komisar. In hi s initial e-mail, he talked about reading one of Komisar\u2019s Harvard Business Review articles and feeling inspired to ask him, \u201cWhen were you happiest in your life?\u201d After Komisar rep lied with references to Tibetan Buddhism, Marrinan responded, \u201cJust as words are inadequate to explain true happiness, so too are words in adequate to express my tha nks.\u201d His e-mail included his personal translation of a French poem by Taisen Deshimaru, the former European head of Soto Zen. An e-mail relationshi p was formed, and Komisar even e-mailed Marrinan a few days later with a link to a New York Times article on happiness. Contacting Schmidt proved more challeng ing. For Marrinan,", "the toughest part was getting Schmidt\u2019s personal e-mail address. He e-mailed a Princeton dean asking for it. No response. Two weeks later, he e-mailed the same dean again, defending his request by reminding her that he had previously met Schmidt. The dean said no, but Marrinan refused to give up. He e-mailed her a thir d time. \u201cHave you ever made an exception?\u201d he asked. The dean finally gave in, he sa id, and provided him with Schmidt\u2019s e-mail. \u201cI know some of my classmates pursued th e alternative scatters hot technique with some success, but that\u2019s not my bag,\u201d Marr inan said, explaining his perseverance. \u201cI deal with rejection by persisting, not by taking my business elsewhere.

Fail better. \u2019 You won\u2019t believe what you can accomplish by attempting the impossible with the courage to repeatedly fail better.\u201d Nathan Kaplan, another participant in the contest, was most proud of the way that he was able to contact former Newark mayor Sharpe James.

Start thi nking of income and expense in terms of monthly cash flow\u2014dollars in and dollars out \u2014instead of grand to tals. Things often cost much, much less than expected. For example, a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, fresh off the showroom floor at $260,000, can be had for $2,897.80 per month. I found my personal favorite, an Aston Martin DB 9 with 1,000 miles on it, through eBay for $136,000\u2014$2,003.10 per month. How about a Round-th e-World trip (Los", "Angeles Tokyo Singapore Bangkok Delhi or Bombay London Frankfurt Los Angeles) for $1,399? For some of these costs, the Tools and Tricks at the end of Chapter 14 will help. Last, calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for realizin g these dreamlines. This is how to do it: First, total each of the columns A, B, and C, counting only the four selected dreams. Some of these column totals could be zero, which is fine. Next, add your total monthly expenses x 1.3 (the 1.3 represents your expenses plus a 30% buffer for safety or savings). This grand tota l is your TMI and the target to keep in mind for the rest of the book. I like to further divide th is TMI by 30 to get my TDI\u2014 Target Daily Income.

W h i l e t h e f i r s t t w o should certainly be totaled and included in your target monthly income, the trip is something that should be divided by the number of months be tween now and the dreamline\u2019s total time. Thus if you had a six-month dreamline: Aston Martin = 2,003 per month Personal assistant = 400 per month Croatian trip = 934 total, and thus 934/6 per month Right now in the book and in the spr eadsheet we have (2003 + 400 + 934) x 1.3 monthly expenses = Target Monthly Income (or TMI). But I think it should be (2003 + 400 + 934/6 x 1.3 monthly expenses = TMI.

An engineer by training, he started his varied career managing coal mines and later succeeded L\u00e9on Walras as the chair of political economy at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. His seminal work, Cours d\u2019economie politique , included a then little-explored \u201claw\u201d of income distribution that would later bear his name: \u201cPareto\u2019s Law\u201d or the \u201cPar eto Distribution,\u201d in the last decade also popularly called the \u201c80/20 Principle.\u201d The mathematical formula he used to de monstrate a grossly uneven but predictable distribution of wealth in society\u201480% of the wealth and income was produced and possessed by 20% of the population\u2014also app lied outside of economics. Indeed, it could be found almost everywhere. Eighty pe rcent of Pareto\u2019s garden peas were produced by 20% of the peapods he had planted, for example. Pareto\u2019s Law can be summarized as follows : 80% of the outputs re sult from 20% of the inputs. Alternative ways to phrase this, depending on the context, include: 80% of the consequences flow from 20% of the causes. 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort and time. 80% of company", "profits come from 20% of the products and customers. 80% of all stock market gains are realized b y 2 0 % o f t h e i n v e s t o r s a n d 2 0 % o f a n individual portfolio. The list is infinitely long and diverse, a nd the ratio is often skewed even more severely: 90/10, 95/5, and 99/1 are not uncommon, but the mi nimum ratio to seek is 80/20. When I came across Pareto\u2019s work one late evening, I had been slaving away with 15-hour days seven days per week, feelin g completely overwhelmed and generally helpless. I would wake up before dawn to make calls to the United Kingdom, handle the U.S. during the normal 9\u20135 day, and then work until near midnight making calls to Japan and New Zealand. I was stuck on a runaway freight train with no brakes, shoveling coal into the furnace for lack of a better option. Faced with certain burnout or giving Pareto\u2019s ideas a tria l run, I opted for the latter. The next morning, I began a dissection of my business and personal li fe through the lenses of", "two questions: 1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80 % of my problems and unhappiness? 2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?

In the 24 hours", "that followed, I made several simple but em otionally difficult decisions that literally changed my life forever and enab led the lifestyle I now enjoy. The first decision I made is an excellent example of how dramatic and fast the ROI of this analytical fat-cutting can be: I stopped contacting 95% of my customers and fired 2%, leaving me with the top 3% of producers to profile and duplicate. Out of more than 120 wholesale customers, a mere 5 were bringing in 95% of the revenue. I was spending 98% of my time chasing the remainder, as the aforementioned 5 ordered regularly wit hout any follow-up calls, persuasion, or cajoling. In other words, I was working because I felt as though I should be doing something from 9\u20135. I didn\u2019t realize that wo rking every hour from 9\u20135 isn\u2019t the goal; it\u2019s simply the structure most people use, wh ether it\u2019s necessary or not. I had a severe case of work-for-work (W4W), the most-hated acronym in the NR vocabulary. All, and I mean 100%, of my problems a nd complaints came from this unproductive majority, with the exception of two larg e customers who were simply world-class experts of the", "\u201chere is the fi re I started, now you put it out\u201d approach to business. I put all of these unproductive cust omers on passive mode: If th ey ordered, great\u2014let them fax in the order. If not, I would do absolu tely no chasing: no phone calls, no e-mail, nothing. That left the two larg er customers to deal with, who were professional ball breakers but contributed about 10% to the bottom line at the time. You\u2019ll always have a few of these, and it is a quandary that causes all sorts of problems, not the least of which are self-hat red and depression. Up to that point, I had taken their browbeating, insults, time-cons uming arguments, and tirades as a cost of doing business. I realized during the 80/20 an alysis that these two people were the source of nearly all my unhappiness and anger throughout the day, and it usually spilled over into my personal time, keeping me up at night with the usual \u201cI should have said X, Y, and Z to that penis\u201d se lf-flagellation. I finally concluded the obvious: The effect on my self-esteem and state of mind just wasn\u2019t worth the financial gain.", "I didn\u2019t need the money for any precise reason, and I had assumed I needed to take it. The customers are always right, aren\u2019t they ? Part of doing busine ss, right? Hell, no. Not for the NR, anyway. I fired their asses and enj oyed every second of it. The first conversation went like this: Customer: What the &#@$? I ordered two cases a n d t h e y a r r i v e d t w o d a y s l a t e . [Note: He had sent the order to the wrong person vi a the wrong medium, despite repeated reminders.] You guys are the most d i s o r g a n i z e d b u n c h o f i d i o t s I \u2019 v e e v e r worked with. I have 20 years of experience in this industry, and this is the worst. Any NR \u2014in this case, me: I will kill you. Be afraid, be very afraid. I wish. I did rehearse that a million times in my mental theater, but it actually went something more like this: I\u2019m sorry", "to hear that. Y ou know, I\u2019ve been taking your in sults for a while now, and it\u2019s unfortunate that it seems we won\u2019t be able to do business anymore. I\u2019d recommend you take a good look at where th is unhappiness and a nger is actually coming from. In any case, I wish you well. If you would like to order product, we\u2019ll be", "happy to supply it, but only if you can conduct yourself wit hout profanity and unnecessary insults. You have our fax numb er. All the best and have a nice day. [Click.] I did this once via phone and once through e-mail. So what happened? I lost one customer, but the other corrected course a nd simply faxed orders, again and again and again. Problem solved, minimum revenue lo st. I was immediately 10 times happier. I then identified the common characteristics of my top-five customers and secured three or so similarly profiled buyers in the following week. Remember, more customers is not automatically more income. More customers is not the goal and often translates into 90% more housekeeping a nd a paltry 1\u20133% increas e in income. Make no mistake, maximum income from minima l necessary effort (including minimum number of customers) is the primary goal. I duplicated my strengths, in this case my top producers, and focused on increasing th e size and frequency of their orders. The end result? I went from chasing and appeasing 120 customers to simply receiving large orders from 8, with ab solutely no pleading phone calls or e-mail haranguing. My monthly income", "increased fr om $30K to $60K in four weeks and my weekly hours immediately dropped from o v e r 8 0 t o a p p r o x i m a t e l y 1 5 . M o s t important, I was happy with myself and felt both optimistic and liberated for the first time in over two years. In the ensuing weeks, I applied the 80/20 Principle to dozens of areas, including the following: 1. Advertising I identified the advertising that was genera ting 80% or more of revenue, identified the commonalities among them, and multiplied them , eliminating all the rest at the same time. My advertising costs dropped over 70 % and my direct sales income nearly doubled from a monthly $15K to $25K in 8 w e e k s . I t w o u l d h a v e d o u b l e d immediately had I been using radio, newspa pers, or television instead of magazines with long lead times. 2. Online Affiliates and Partners I fired more than 250 low-yield online affili ates or put them in holding patterns to focus instead on the", "two a f f i l i a t e s w h o w e r e g e n e r a t i n g 9 0 % o f t h e i n c o m e . M y management time decreased from 5\u201310 hours per week to 1 hour per month. Online partner income increased more th an 50% in that same month. Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference. Being busy is a form of laziness\u2014lazy thinking and indiscriminate action . Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant. Being selective\u2014doing less\u2014is th e path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.", "Of course, before you can separate the wheat from the chaff and eliminate activities in a new environment (whether a new job or an entrepreneurial venture), you will need to try a lot to identify what pulls the most weight. Throw it all up on the wall and see what sticks. That\u2019s part of the process, but it should not take more than a month or two. It\u2019s easy to get caught in a flood of minuti ae, and the key to not feeling rushed is remembering that lack of time is actually lack of priorities . Take time to stop and smell the roses, or\u2014in this case\u2014to count the pea pods. The 9\u20135 Illusion and Parkinson\u2019s Law I saw a bank that said \u201c24-Hour Banki ng,\u201d but I don\u2019t have that much time. \u2014STEVEN WRIGHT, comedian If you\u2019re an employee, spending time on nonsen se is, to some extent, not your fault. There is often no incentive to use time well unless you are paid on commission. The world has agreed to shuffle papers between 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M., and since you\u2019re trapped in the office for that period of serv itude, you are compelled to create activities", "to fill that time. Time is wasted because t h e r e i s s o m u c h t i m e a v a i l a b l e . I t \u2019 s understandable. Now that you have the ne w goal of negotiating a remote work arrangement instead of just collecting a payc heck, it\u2019s time to re visit the status quo and become effective. The best employees have the most leverage. For the entrepreneur, the wasteful use of time is a matter of bad habit and imitation. I am no exception. Most entrepreneurs were once employees and come from the 9\u20135 culture. Thus they adopt the same schedul e, whether or not they function at 9:00 A.M. or need 8 hours to generate their target income. This schedule is a collective social agreement and a dinosaur legacy of the results-by-volume approach. How is it possible that all the people in the world need exactly 8 hours to accomplish their work? It isn\u2019t. 9\u20135 is arbitrary. You don\u2019t need 8 hours per day to become a legitimate millionaire\u2014let alone have the means to live like one. Eight hours per w eek is often", "excessive, but I don\u2019t expect all of you to believe me just yet. I know you probably feel as I did for a long time: There just aren\u2019t enough hours in the day. But let\u2019s consider a few things we can probably agree on. Since we have 8 hours to fill, we fill 8 hours. If we had 15, we would fill 15. If we have an emergency and need to suddenly leave work in 2 hours but have pending deadlines, we miraculously complete those assignments in 2 hours. It is all related to a law that was introduced to me by Ed Zschau in the spring of 2000.", "I had arrived to class nervous and unable to concentrate. The final paper, worth a full 25% of the semester\u2019s grade, was due in 24 hours. One of the options, and that which I had chosen, was to interview the t op executives of a start-up and provide an in-depth analysis of their business model. The corporate powers that be had decided last minute that I couldn\u2019t interview two ke y figures or use their information due to confidentiality issues and pre-IPO precautions. Game over. I approached Ed after class to deliver the bad news. \u201cEd, I think I\u2019m going to need an extension on the paper.\u201d I explai ned the situation, and Ed smiled before he replied without so much as a hint of concern. \u201cI think you\u2019ll be OK. Entrepreneurs ar e those who make things happen, right?\u201d Twenty-four hours later and one minute befo re the deadline, as his assistant was locking the office, I handed in a 30-page final paper. It was based on a different company I had found, interviewed, and disse cted with an intense all-nighter and enough caffeine to get an entire Olympic tr ack team disqualifie d. It ended up being one", "of the best papers I\u2019d written in four years, and I received an A. Before I left the classroom the previous day, Ed had given me some parting advice: Parkinson\u2019s Law. Parkinson\u2019s Law dictates that a task w ill swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you ha ve no choice but to do only the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it\u2019s six days of making a mountain out of a molehill. If I give you tw o months, God forbid, it becomes a mental monster. The end product of the shorter deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater focus. This presents a very curious phenomenon. Th ere are two synergistic approaches for increasing productivity that ar e inversions of each other: 1. Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20). 2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson\u2019s Law). The best solution is to use", "both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines. If you haven\u2019t identified the mission-critical tasks and set aggressive start and end times for their completion, the unimportant becomes the importan t. Even if you know what\u2019s critical, wit hout deadlines that cr eate focus, the minor tasks forced upon you (or invented, in the case of the entrepreneur ) will swell to consume time until another bit of minutiae jumps in to replace it, leav ing you at the end of the day with nothing accomplished. How else could dropping off a package at UPS, setting a few appointments, and checking e-mail consume an entire 9\u20135 day? Don\u2019 t feel bad. I spent months jumping from one interruption to th e next, feeling run by my business instead of the other way around.", "THE 80/20 PRINCIPLE and Parkinson\u2019s Law are the two cornerstone concepts that will be revisited in different forms throughout th is entire section. Mo st inputs are useless and time is wasted in proportion to the amount that is available. Fat-free performance and time freedom begins with limiting intake overload. In the next chapter, we\u2019ll put you on the real breakfast of ch ampions: the Low-Information Diet. A Dozen Cupcakes and One Question Love of bustle is not industry. \u2014SENECA MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA. \u201cS aturdays are my days off,\u201d I offered to the crowd of strang ers staring at me, friends of a friend. It was true. Can you eat All-Bran and chicken seven days a week? Me neither. Don\u2019t be so judgmental. Between my tenth and twelfth cupcakes, I plopped down on the couch to revel in the sugar high until the clock struck midnight a n d s e n t m e b a c k t o m y a d u l t s v i l l e Sunday\u2013Friday diet. There was another party guest seated next to me on a chair, nursing a glass of wine, not hi s twelfth but certainly not", "hi s first, and we struck up a conversation. As usual, I had to struggle to answer \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d and, as usual, my answer left someone to wonder whether I was a pathological liar or a criminal. How was it possible to sp end so little time on income generation? It\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s THE question. In almost all respects, Charney had it all. He was happily married with a two-year- old son and another due to arrive in thr ee months. He was a successful technology salesman, and though he wanted to earn $500,000 more per year as a ll do, his finances were solid. He also asked good questions. I had just re turned from another trip overseas and was planning a new adventure to Japan. He drilled me for two hours with a refrain: How is it possible to spend so lit tle time on income generation? \u201cIf you\u2019re interested, we can make you a case study and I\u2019ll show you how,\u201d I offered. Charney was in. The one thing he didn\u2019t have was time. One e-mail and five weeks of practice later, Charney had good news: He had accomplished more in the last", "week than he had in the previous four combined. He did so while taking Monday and Friday off a nd spending at least 2 more hours per day with his family. From 40 hours per week, he was down to 18 and producing four times the results.", "Was it from mountaintop retreats and secret kung fu training? Nope. Was it a new Japanese management secret or better so ftware? Nein. I just asked him to do one simple thing consistently without fail. At least three times per day at scheduled times, he had to ask himself the following question: Am I being productive or just active? Charney captured the essence of th is with less-abstract wording: Am I inventing things to do to avoid the important? He eliminated all of the activities he used as crutches and began to focus on demonstrating results instead of showi ng dedication. Dedication is often just meaningless work in disguise. Be ruthless and cut the fat. It is possible to have you r cupcake and eat it, too. Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS We create stress for ourselves because you feel like you have to do it. You have to. I don\u2019t feel that anymore. \u2014OPRAH WINFREY , actress and talk-show host, The Oprah Winfrey Show The key to having more time is doing less, an d there are two paths to getting there, both of which should be used together: (1) De fine a to-do list and (2) define a not-to-", "do list. In general terms, there are but two questions: What 20% of sources are causing 80 % of my problems and unhappiness? What 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired ou tcome and happiness? Hypothetical cases help to get us started: 1. If you had a heart attack and had to work two hours per day, what would you do? Not five hours, not four hours, not thr ee\u2014two hours. It\u2019s not where I want you to ultimately be, but it\u2019s a start. Besides, I can hear your brain bubbling already: That\u2019s ridiculous. Impossible! I know, I know. If I told you that you could survive for months, functioning quite well, on four hour s of sleep per night, would you believe me? Probably not. Notwithstanding, millions of new mothers do it all the time. This exercise is not optional. The doctor has warn ed you, after triple-bypass surgery, that if you don\u2019t cut down your work to two hours per day for the first three months post-op, you will die. How would you do it?", "2. If you had a second heart attack and had to work two hours per week , what would you do? 3. If you had a gun to your head and had to stop doing 4/5 of different time- consuming activities, what would you remove? Simplicity requires ruthlessness. If you had to stop of time-consuming activities\u2014e-ma il, phone calls, conversations, paperwork, meetings, advertisi ng, customers, suppliers, pr oducts, services, etc.\u2014what would you eliminate to keep the negative eff ect on income to a minimum? Used even once per month, this question alone can keep you sane and on track. 4. What are the top-three activities that I us e to fill time to fe el as though I\u2019ve been productive? These are usually used to postpone more important actions (often uncomfortable because there is a chance of failure or rej ection). Be honest with yourself, as we all do this on occasion. What are your crutch activities? 5. Who are the 20% of people who produce 80% of your enjoyment and propel you forward, and which 20% cause 80% of your depression, anger, and second- guessing? Identify: \uf0b7 Positive friends versus time-consuming friends: Who is helping versus hurting you, and", "how do you increase your time with the former while decreasing or eliminating your time with the latter? \uf0b7 Who is causing me stress disproportionate to the time I spend with them? What will happen if I simply stop interacting with these people? Fear- setting helps here. \uf0b7 When do I feel starved for time? What commitments, thoughts, and people can I eliminate to fix this problem? Exact numbers aren\u2019t needed to realize th at we spend too much time with those who poison us with pessimism, sloth, and low expectations of themselves and the world. It is often the case that you have to fire certain friends or retire from particular social circles to have the life you want. This isn\u2019 t being mean; it is bei ng practical. Poisonous people do not deserve your time. To think otherwise is masochistic. The best way to approach a potential break is simple: Confide in them honestly but tactfully and explain your concerns. If they bite back, your conclusions have been confirmed. Drop them like any other bad habit. If they promise to change, first spend", "at least two weeks apar t to develop other positive influe nces in your life and diminish psychological dependency. The next trial peri od should have a set duration and consist of pass-or-fail criteria. If this approach is too conf rontational for you, just politel y refuse to interact with them. Be in the middle of something when the call comes, and have a prior commitment when the invitation to hang out comes. Once you see the benefits of decreased time with these people, it will be easier to stop communication altogether. I\u2019m not going to lie: It sucks. It hurt s like pulling out a splinter. But you are the average of the five people you associate wi th most, so do not underestimate the effects of your pessimistic, unambitious, or disorg anized friends. If someone isn\u2019t making you stronger, they\u2019re making you weaker. Remove the splinters and you\u2019ll thank yourself for it. 6. Learn to ask, \u201cIf this is the only thin g I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?\u201d Don\u2019t ever arrive at the office or in front of your computer without a clear list of priorities. You\u2019ll just read unassociated e- mail and", "scramble your brain for the day. Compile your to-do list for tomorrow no later than this evening. I don\u2019t recommend using Outlook or computerized to-do lists, be cause it is possible to add an infinite number of items. I use a standard piece of pa per folded in half three times, which fits perfectly in the pocket and limits you to noting only a few items. There should never be more than two missi on-critical items to complete each day. Never. It just isn\u2019t necessary if they\u2019re ac tually high-impact. If you are stuck trying to decide between multiple items th at all seem crucial, as happens to all of us, look at each in turn and ask yourself, If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day? To counter the seemingly urgent, ask yourse lf: What will happen if I don\u2019t do this, and is it worth putting off the important to do it? If you haven\u2019t already accomplished at least one important task in the day, don\u2019t spend the last business hour returning a DVD to avoid a $5 late charge. Get the important task done and pay the $5 fine.", "7. Put a Post-it on your computer screen or set an Outlook reminder to alert you at least three times daily with the questio n: Are you inventing things to do to avoid the important? I also use free time-tracking so ftware called RescueTime ( www.rescuetime.com ) to alert me when I spend more than an allo tted time on certain websites or programs often used to avoid the important (Gmail, Facebook, Outlook, etc.). It also summarizes your time use each week and compares your performance to peers. 8. Do not multitask . I\u2019m going to tell you what you already know. Trying to brush your teeth, talk on the phone, and answer e-mail at the same time just doesn\u2019t work. Eating while doing online research and instant messaging? Ditto. If you prioritize properly, there is no need to multitask. It is a symptom of \u201ctask creep\u201d\u2014doing more to feel productive while actually a ccomplishing less. As stated, you should have, at most, two primary goals or tasks per day. Do them separately", "from start to finish without distraction. Divi ded attention will resu lt in more frequent interruptions, lapses in c oncentration, poorer net resu lts, and less gratification. 9. Use Parkinson\u2019s Law on a Macro and Micro Level . Use Parkinson\u2019s Law to accomplish more in less time. Shorten schedules and deadlines to necessitate fo cused action instead of delib eration and procrastination. On a weekly and daily macro level, attemp t to take Monday and/or Friday off, as well as leave work at 4 P.M. This will focus you to prio ritize more effectively and quite possibly develop a social life. If you\u2019re under the hawklike watch of a boss, we\u2019ll discuss the nuts and bolts of how to escape in later chapters. On a micro task level, limit the numb er of items on your to-do list and use impossibly short deadlines to force immediate action while ignoring minutiae. If doing work online or near an online computer, http://e.ggtimer.com/ is a convenient countdown timer. Just type the desired time limit directly into the URL field and hit enter.

Checking Pareto\u2019s Law I realized that 78% of my downloads came from just one of my CDs and that 55% of my total download incom e cam e from only five songs! It showed me what my fans are looking for and allowed me to showcase those on", "my web site. Downloads are the way to go. iT unes sells the song and CD Baby direct deposits it to my account. Fully automated once the recording is done. There are some", "months I can live off download income. Once I finish paying off de bt, it should be no problem to travel as an artist and create ne w fans all over the world and have a cyber income stream. \u2014VICTOR JOHNSON As for \u201coutsourcing\u201d your banking, any company that needs to take checks (cheques) should consider a lock box solu tion. Just about any bank that does business banking offers it. All checks go to a PO box at the bank, the bank pr ocesses the checks and deposits them, and according to your instructions can send you a file of all the checks that are deposited. Normally this can be done in either a flat , Excel or other file type that can interface with any accounting systems from Excel, to Quicken to SAP. Quite cost effective. \u2014ANONYMOUS The Low-Information Diet CULTIVATING SELECTIVE IGNORANCE What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence, a wealth of in formation creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that atten tion efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it. \u2014HERBERT SIMON , recipient of Nobel Memo rial Prize in Economics8 and", "the A.M. Turing Award, the \u201cNobel Prize of Computer Science\u201d Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits.

I\u2019ll answer all of that, but wait\u2014it gets better. I usually check business e-mail for about an hour each Monday, and I never check voicemail when abroad. Never ever. But what if someone has an emergency? It doesn\u2019t happen. My contacts now know that I don\u2019t respond to emergencies, so the emergencies somehow don\u2019t exist or don\u2019t come to me. Problems, as a rule, solve themselves or di sappear if you remove yourself as an information bottleneck and empower others. Cultivating Selective Ignorance There are many things of which a wise man might wish to be ignorant. \u2014RALPH WALDO EMERSON (1803\u20131882) From this point forward, I\u2019m going to propose that you develop an uncanny ability to be selectively ignorant. Ignorance may be b l i s s , b u", "t i t i s a l so practical. It is imperative that you learn to ignore or redirect all information and interruptions that are irrelevant, unimportant, or unact ionable. Most are all three. The first step is to develop and maintain a low-information diet. Just as modern man consumes both too many calories and calor ies of no nutritional value, information workers eat data both in exce ss and from the wrong sources. Lifestyle design is based on massive actio n\u2014output. Increased output necessitates decreased input. Most information is time- consuming, negative, ir relevant to your goals, and outside of your influence. I cha llenge you to look at whatever you read or watched today and tell me that it wasn\u2019t at least two of the four. I read the front-page headlines through the newspaper machines as I walk to lunch each day and nothing more. In five years, I haven\u2019t had a single problem due to this selective ignorance. It gives you something new to ask the rest of the population in lieu of small talk: \u201cTell me, what\u2019s new in t h e w o r l d ? \u201d A n d , i f it\u2019s", "that important, you\u2019ll hear people talking about it. Using my crib notes approach to world affairs, I also retain more than someone who loses the forest for the trees in a sea of extraneous details.

That\u2019s it for results-oriented reading. I read an hour of fic tion prior to bed for relaxation.", "How on earth do I act responsibly? Let me give an example of how I and other NR both consider and obtain information. I vot ed in the last presidential election,9 despite having been in Berlin. I made my decision in a matter of hours. First, I sent e-mails to educated friends in the U.S. who share my v a l u e s a n d a s k e d t h e m w h o t h e y w e r e voting for and why. Second, I judge people ba sed on actions and not words; thus, I asked friends in Berlin, who had more pers pective outside of U.S. media propaganda, how they judged the candidates based on their historical behavior. Last, I watched the presidential debates. That was it. I let ot her dependable people synthesize hundreds of hours and thousands of pages of media for me. It was like having dozens of personal information assistants, and I didn\u2019t have to pay them a single cent. That\u2019s a simple example, you say, but what if you need to learn to do something your friends haven\u2019t done? Like, say, sell a book to", "the world\u2019s largest publisher as a first-time author? Funny you should ask. There are two appr oaches I used: 1. I picked one book out of dozens based on reader reviews and the fact that the authors had actually done what I wanted to do. If the task is how-to in nature, I only read accounts that are \u201chow I did it\u201d and autobiographical. No speculators or wannabes are worth the time. 2. Using the book to generate intelligent and specific questions, I contacted 10 of the top authors and agents in the world via e- mail and phone, with a response rate of 80%. I only read the secti ons of the book that were releva nt to immediate next steps, which took less than two hours. To develop a template e-mail and call script took approximately four hours, and the actual e-mails and phone calls t o o k l e s s t h a n a n hour. This personal contact appr oach is not only more ef fective and more efficient than all-you-can-eat info buffets, it also pr ovided me with the major league alliances and mentors necessary to sell this book.

How to Read 200% Faster in 10 Minutes There will be times when, it\u2019s true, you will have to read. Here are four simple tips that will lessen the damage and increase you r speed at least 200% in 10 minutes with no comprehension loss: 1. Two Minutes: Use a pen or finger to trace under each line as you read as fast as possible . Reading is a series of jumping snapshots (called saccades), and using a visual guide prevents regression. 2. Three Minutes: Begin each line focusing on the third word in from the first word, and end each line focusing on the third word in from the last word . This makes use of peripheral vision th at is otherwise wasted on margins.", "For example, even when the highlighted words in the next line are your beginning and ending focal points, the entire sentence is \u201cread,\u201d just with less eye movement: \u201cOnce upon a time, an information addict decided to detox.\u201d Move in from both sides further and further as it gets easier. 3. Two Minutes: Once comfortable indenting th ree or four words from both sides, attempt to take only two sn apshots\u2014also known as fixations\u2014per line on the first and last indented words . 4. Three Minutes: Practice reading too fast for comprehension but with good technique (the above three techniques) for five pages prior to reading at a comfortable speed . This will heighten per ception and rese t your speed limit, much like how 50 mph normally feel s fast but seems like slow motion if you drop down from 70 mph on the freeway. To calculate reading speed in words pe r minute (wpm)\u2014and thus progress\u2014in a given book, add up the number of words in ten lines and divide by ten to get the average words per line. Multiply this by the number of lines per page and you have the average words per page. Now it\u2019s", "simple . If you initially read 1.25 pages in one minute at 330 average words per page, that\u2019s 412.5 words per minute. If you then read 3.5 pages after training, it\u2019s 1,155 words per mi nute and you\u2019re in the top 1% of the world\u2019s fastest readers.

Not All Evils Are Created Equal For our purposes, an interruption is anyt hing that prevents the start-to-finish completion of a critical task, and there are three principal offenders: 1. Time wasters: t h o s e t h i n g s t h a t c a n b e ignored with little or no consequence. Common time wasters in clude meetings, discussions, phone calls, web surfing, and e-mail that are unimportant . 2. Time consumers: repetitive tasks or requests that need to be completed but often interrupt high-level work. He re are a few you might know intimately: reading and responding to e-mail, maki ng and returning phone calls, customer service (order status, product assistance, e t c . ) , f i n a n c", "i a l o r s a l e s r e p o r t i n g , personal errands, all necessary repeated actions and tasks. 3.

Here are just a few: fixing customer problems (lost shipments, damaged shipments, ma lfunctions, etc.), customer contact, cash expenditures of all types.

This is the greatest single interruption in the modern world. 1. Turn off the audible alert if you have one on Outlook or a similar program and turn off automatic send/re ceive, which delivers e-mail to your inbox as soon as someone sends them. 2.

LIGHT GRAY INDICATES TIME A VAILABLE FOR HIGH-P RIORITY TASKS . Courtesy of SANDIA Before implementing the twice-daily ro utine, you must create an e-mail autoresponse that will train your boss, co-w orkers, suppliers, and clients to be more effective. I would recommend that you do no t ask to implement this. Remember one of our ten commandments: Beg for fo rgiveness; don\u2019t ask for", "permission. If this gives you heart palpitations, speak with your immediate supervisor and propose to trial the approach f o r o n e t o t h r e e d a y s . Cite pending projects and frustration with constant inte rruptions as the reasons. Feel free to blame it on spam or someone outside of the office. Here is a simple e-mail template that can be used: Greetings, Friends [or Esteemed Colleagues], Due to high workload, I am currently checking and responding to e-mail twice daily at 12:00 p.m. ET [or your time zone] and 4:00 p.m. ET.", "If you require urgent assistan ce (please ensure it is ur gent) that cannot wait until either 12:00 p.m. or 4:00 p.m., please contact me via phone at 555\u2013555\u20135555. Thank you for understanding this move to more efficiency and effectiveness. It helps me accomplish more to serve you better. Sincerely, Tim Ferriss MOVE TO ONCE-PER-DAY as quickly as possible. Emerge ncies are seldom that. People are poor judges of importance a nd inflate minutiae to fill time and feel important. This autoresponse is a tool that, far from decr easing collective effectiveness, forces people to re-evaluate their reason for interrup ting you and helps them decrease meaningless and time-consuming contact. I was initially terrified of missing important requests and inviting disaster, just as you might be upon reading this recommenda tion. Nothing happened. Give it a shot and work out the small bumps as you progress. For an extreme example of a personal au toresponder that has never prompted a complaint and allowed me to check e-mail once per week, send an e-mail to template@fourhourworkweek.com . It has been revised over three years and works like a charm. The second step is to screen in coming and limit outgoing phone", "calls. 1. Use two telephone numbers if possibl e\u2014one office line (non urgent) and one cellular (urgent). This could also be two ce ll phones, or the non- urgent line could be an Internet phone number that rout es calls to on line voicemail ( www.skype.com , for example). Use the cell number in the e-mail autoresponse and answer it at a ll times unless it is an unknown caller or it is a call you don\u2019t want to answer. If in doubt, allow the call to go to voicemail and listen to the voicem ail immediately afterward to gauge importance. If it can wait, let it wait. The offending parties have to learn to wait. The office phone should be put on silent mode and allowed to go to voicemail at all times. The voicemail recording should sound familiar: You\u2019ve reached the desk of Tim Ferriss. I am currently checking and responding to voicemail twice daily at 12:00 p.m. ET [or your time zone] and 4:00 p.m. ET. If you require assistance with a truly urge nt matter that cannot wait until either 12:00 p.m. or 4:00 p.m., please contact me on my cell at 555\u2013555\u20135555. Otherwise, please leave", "a message and I w ill return it at the next of those two times. Be sure to leave your e-mail address, as I am often able to respond faster that way. Thank you for understanding this move to mo re efficiency and effectiveness. It helps me accomplish more to serve you better. Have a wonderful day.", "2. If someone does call your cell phone, it is presumably urgent and should be treated as such. Do not allow them to consume ti me otherwise. It\u2019s all in the greeting. Compare the following: Jane (receiver) :Hello? John (caller) : Hi, is this Jane? Jane: This is Jane. John: Hi, Jane, it\u2019s John. Jane: Oh, hi, John. How are you? (or) Oh, hi, John. What\u2019s going on? John will now digress and lead you into a conversation about nothi ng, from which you will have to recover and then fish out the ultimate purpose of the call. There is a better approach: Jane: This is Jane speaking. John: Hi, it\u2019s John. Jane: Hi, John. I\u2019m right in the middle of something. How can I help you out? Potential continuation: John: Oh, I can call back. Jane: No, I have a minute. What can I do for you? Don\u2019t encourage people to chitchat and don\u2019t le t them chitchat. Get them to the point immediately. If they meander or try to postpone for a later undefined call, reel them in and get them to come to the point. If they go into a long description of a problem, cut in", "with, \u201c[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I ha ve a call in five minutes. What can I do to help out?\u201d You might instead sa y, \u201c[Name], sorry to interrupt , but I have a call in five minutes. Can you send me an e-mail?\u201d The third step is to master the ar t of refusal and avoiding meetings. THE FIRST DAY our new Sales VP arrived at True SAN in 2001, he came into the all- company meeting and made an announcement in just about this many words: \u201cI am not here to make friends. I have been hired to build a sales team and sell product, and that\u2019s what I intend to do. Thanks.\u201d So much for small talk. He proceeded to deliver on his promise. Th e office socializers disliked him for his no-nonsense approach to communication, but everyone respected his time. He wasn\u2019t rude without reason, but he was direct and kept the pe ople around him focused. Some didn\u2019t consider him charismatic, but no one considered him anything less than spectacularly effective.", "I remember sitting down in his office for our first one-on-one meeting. Fresh off four years of rigorous academic training, I immediately jumped into explaining the prospect profiles, elaborate planning I\u2019d de veloped, responses to date, and so forth and so on. I had spent at least two hours prepar ing to make this first impression a good one. He listened with a smile on his face for no more than two minutes and then held up a hand. I stopped. He laughed in a kind-he arted manner and said, \u201cTim, I don\u2019t want the story. Just tell me what we need to do.\u201d Over the following weeks, he trained me t o r e c o g n i z e w h e n I w a s u n f o c u s e d o r focused on the wrong things, which meant anyt hing that didn\u2019t move the top two or three clients one step closer to signing a purchase order. Our meetings were now no more than five minutes long. From this moment forward, resolve to keep those around you focused and avoid all meetings, whether in person or remote, that do not", "have clear object ives. It is possible to do this tactfully, but expect that some time wasters will be offended the first few times their advances are reject ed. Once it is clear that re maining on task is your policy and not subject to change, they will accept it and move on with life. Hard feelings pass. Don\u2019t suffer fools or you\u2019ll become one. It is your job to tr ain those around you to be effective and efficient . No one else will do it for you. Here are a few recommendations: 1. Decide that, given the non-urgent nature of most issues, you will steer people toward the following means of communicati on, in order of pref erence: e-mail, phone, and in-person meetings. If someone proposes a meeting, request an e-mail instead and then use the phone as your fallback offer if need be. Cite other immediately pending work tasks as the reason. 2. Respond to voicemail via e-mail whenever possible. This trains people to be concise. Help them develop the habit. Similar to our opening greeting on th e phone, e-mail communication should be streamlined to prevent need less back-and-forth. Thus, an e-mail with \u201cCan you meet", "at 4:00 P.M.? \u201d would become \u201cCan you meet at 4:00 P.M.? If so If not, please advise three other times that work for you.\u201d This \u201cif \u2026 then\u201d structure becomes more important as you check e-mail less often. Since I only check e-mail once a week, it is cr itical that no one needs a \u201cwhat if?\u201d answered or other information within seven days of a given e-mail I send. If I suspect that a manufacturing order hasn\u2019t arrived at the shipping facility, for example, I\u2019ll send an e-mail to my shipping facility manager along these lines: \u201cDear Susan \u2026 Has the new manufacturing shipment arrived? If so, please advise me o n \u2026 I f n o t , p l e a s e contact John Doe at 555\u20135555 or via e-mail at john@doe.com (he is also CC\u2019d) and advise on delivery date and tracking. John, if there are any issues with the shipment, please coordinate with Susan, reachable at 555\u20134444, who has the authority to make decisions up to $500 on my behalf. In cas e of emergency, call me on my cell phone, but I trust you two. Thanks.\u201d This preven ts most follow-up questions,", "avoids two separate dialogues, and takes me out of the problem-solving equation.", "Get into the habit of considering what \u201cif \u2026 then\u201d actions can be proposed in any e- mail where you ask a question. 3. Meetings should only be held to make deci sions about a predefined situation, not to define the problem. If someone proposes that yo u meet with them or \u201cset a time to talk on the phone,\u201d ask that person to send you an e-mail with an agenda to define the purpose: That sounds doable. So I can best prepare, can you pl ease send me an e-mail with an agenda? That is, the topics and questions we\u2019ll need to addr ess? That would be great. Thanks in advance. Don\u2019t give them a chance to bail out. The \u201cthanks in advance\u201d before a retort increases your chances of getting the e-mail. The e-mail medium forces people to define t h e d e s i r e d o u t c o m e o f a m e e t i n g o r call. Nine times out of ten, a meeting is unnecessary and you can answer the questions, once defined, via e-mail. Impose this habit on others. I haven\u2019t had an in-", "person meeting for my business in more than f i v e y e a r s a n d h a v e had fewer than a dozen conference calls, all lasting less than 30 minutes. 4. Speaking of 30 minutes, if you absolute ly cannot stop a meeting or call from happening, define the end time . Do not leave these discu ssions open-ended, and keep them short. If things are well-defined, d ecisions should not take more than 30 minutes. Cite other commitments at odd times to make them more believable (e.g., 3:20 vs. 3:30) and force people to focus instead of socializing, commiser ating, and digressing. If you must join a meeting that is scheduled to last a long time or that is open-ended, inform the organizer that you would like permission to cover your portion first, as you have a commitment in 15 minutes. If you have to, feign an urgent phone call. Get the hell out of there and have someone else update you later. The other option is to be completely transparent and voice your opini on of how unnecessary the meeting is. If you choose this route, be prepared to face fire", "and offer alternatives. 5. The cubicle is your temple\u2014don\u2019t permit casual visitors. Some suggest using a clear \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign of some type, but I have found that this is ignored unless you have an office. My approach was to put headphones on, even if I wasn\u2019t listening to anything. If someone approached me de spite this discouragement, I would pretend to be on the phone. I\u2019d put a finger to my lips, say something like, \u201cI hear you,\u201d and then say into the mic, \u201cCan you hold on a s econd?\u201d Next, I\u2019d turn to the invader and say, \u201cHi. What can I do for you?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t let them \u201cget back to me\u201d but rather force the person to give me a five-second summary and then send me an e-mail if necessary. If headphone games aren\u2019t your thing, the reflexive response to an invader should be the same as when answering the cell phone: \u201cHi, invader. I\u2019m ri ght in the middle of", "something. How can I be of help?\u201d If it\u2019s no t clear within 30 seconds, ask the person to send you an e-mail about the chosen issue; do not offer to send them an e-mail first: \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to help, but I have to finish this first. Can you send me a quick e-mail to remind me?\u201d If you still cannot deflect an i nvader, give the person a time limit on your availability, which can also be used fo r phone conversations: \u201cOK, I only have two minutes before a call, but what\u2019s the situation and what can I do to help?\u201d 6. Use the Puppy Dog Close to help your supe riors and others develop the no-meeting habit. The Puppy Dog Close in sales is so named because it is based on the pet store sales approach: If someone likes a puppy but is hesitant to make t h e l i f e - a l t e r i n g purchase, just offer to let them take the pup home and bring it back if they change their minds. Of course, the return seldom happens. The Puppy Dog Close is invaluable when ever you", "face resistance to permanent changes. Get your foot in the door with a \u201cl et\u2019s just try it onc e\u201d reversible trial. Compare the following: \u201cI think you\u2019d love this puppy. It will forever add to your responsibilities until he dies 10 years from now. No more care-free vacations, and you\u2019ll fi nally get to pick up poop all over the city\u2014what do you think?\u201d vs. Now imagine walking up to your boss in the hallway and clapping a hand on her shoulder: \u201cI\u2019d like to go to the meeting, but I have a better idea. Let\u2019s never have another one, since all we do is waste time and not decide anything useful.\u201d vs. The second set of alternatives seem less pe rmanent, and they\u2019re intended to appear so.

Time Consumers: Batch and Do Not Falter", "A schedule defends from chaos and whim. \u2014ANNIE DILLARD, winner of Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction, 1975 If you have never used a commercial printer before, the pricing and lead times could surprise you. Let\u2019s assume it costs $310 and takes one w eek to print 20 customized T-shirts with 4-color logos. How much and how long does it take to print 3 of the same T-shirt? $310 and one week. How is that possible? Simple\u2014the setup charges don\u2019t change. It costs the printer the same amount in materials for plate prep aration ($150) and the same in labor to man the press itself ($100). The setup is the real time-consumer, and thus the job, despite its small size, needs to be scheduled just like the other, resulting in the same one-week delivery date. The lower economy of scale picks up the rest: The cost for 3 shirts is $20 per shirt x 3 shirts instead of $3 per shirt x 20 shirts. The cost- and time-effective solution, therefore, is to wait until you have a larger order, an approach called \u201cbatching.\u201d Batchi ng is also the solution to our distracting but necessary time consumers , those repetitive tasks that interrupt", "the most important. If you check mail and make bill payments five times a week, it might take 30 minutes per instance and you respond to a total of 20 letters in two and a half hours. If you do this once per week instead, it might ta ke 60 minutes total and you still respond to a total of 20 letters. People do the former out of fear of emergencies. First, there are seldom real emergencies. Second, of the urgent communication you will receive, missing a deadline is usually reversible a nd otherwise costs a minimum to correct. There is an inescapable setup time for all tasks, large or minuscule in scale. It is often the same for one as it is for a hundred. There is a psychological switching of gears that can require up to 45 minutes to r e s u m e a m a j o r t a s k t h a t h a s b e e n interrupted. More than a quarter of each 9\u20135 period (28%) is consumed by such interruptions.13 This is true of all recurring tasks and is precisely why we have already decided to check", "e-mail and phone calls twice per day at specific predetermined times (between which we let them accumulate). From mid-2004 to 2007, I check ed mail no more than once a week, often not for up to four weeks at a time. Nothing was irre parable, and nothing cost more than $300 to fix. This batching has saved me hundreds of hours of redundant work. How much is your time worth? Let\u2019s use a hypothetical example: 1. $20 per hour is how much you are paid or value your time. This would be the case, for example, if you are paid $40,000 per year and get two weeks of vacation per year ($40,000 divided by [40 hours per week x 5 0 = 2 , 0 0 0 ] = $ 2 0 / h o u r ) . E s t i m a t e y o u r hourly income by cutting the last three zeroes off of your annual income and halving the remaining number (e.g., $50,000/year p $25/hour.", "2. Estimate the amount of time you will save by grouping si milar tasks together and batching them, and calculate how much you have earned by multiplying this hour number by your per-hou r rate ($20 here): 3. Test each of the above batching fre quencies and determine how much problems cost to fix in each period. If the cost is less than the above dollar amounts, batch even further apart. For example, using our above math, if I ch eck e-mail once per week and that results in an average loss of two sales per week, totaling $80 in lost profit, I will continue checking once per week because $200 (10 hours of time) minus $80 is still a $120 net gain, not to mention the enormous benefits of completing other main tasks in those 10 hours. If you calculate the financial and emo tional benefit of completing just one main task (such as landing a major client or co mpleting a life-changing trip), the value of batching is much more th an the per-hour savings. If the problems cost more than hours save d, scale back to the next-less-frequent batch schedule. In this case , I would drop", "from once per we ek to twice per week (not daily) and attempt to fix the system so that I can return to once per week. Do not work harder when the solution is working sm arter. I have batched both personal and business tasks further and further apart as I\u2019ve realized just how few real problems come up. Some of my scheduled batc hes in 2007 were e-mail (Mondays 10:00 A.M.), phone (completely eliminated), laundr y (every other Sunday at 10:00 P.M.), credit cards and bills (most are on automatic paym ent, but I check balances every second Monday after e-mail), strength training (every 4th day for 30 minutes), etc. Empowerment Failure: Rules and Readjustment The vision is really about empower ing workers, giving them all the information about what\u2019s going on so th ey can do a lot more than they\u2019ve done in the past. \u2014BILL GATES , cofounder of Microsoft, richest man in the world Empowerment failure refers to being una ble to accomplish a task without first obtaining permission or information. It is often a case of being micromanaged or micromanaging someone else, both of which consume your time. For the employee, the goal is to", "have full access to necessary information and as much independent decision-making ability as possible. For the entrepreneur, the goal", "is to grant as much information and inde pendent decision-making ability to employees or contractors as possible. Customer service is often the epitome of empowerment failure, and a personal example from BrainQUICKEN illustrates ju st how serious but easily solved the problem can be. In 2002, I had outsourced customer service for order tracking a nd returns but still handled product-related questi ons myself. The result? I rece ived more than 200 e-mail per day, spending all hours between 9\u20135 responding to them, and the volume was growing at a rate of more than 10% per week! I had to cancel advertising and limit shipments, as additional customer service woul d have been the final nail in the coffin. It wasn\u2019t a scalable m o d e l . R e m e m b e r t h i s w o r d , a s it will be important later. It wasn\u2019t scalable because there was an in formation and decision bottleneck: me. The clincher? The bulk of the e-mail th at landed in my inbox was not product- related at all but requests from the out sourced customer service reps seeking permission for different actions: The", "customer claims he didn\u2019t receiv e the shipment. What should we do? The customer had a bottle he ld at customs. Can we reship to a U.S. address? The customer needs the product for a compe tition in two days. Can we ship overnight, and if so, how much should we charge? It was endless. Hundreds upon hundreds of diffe rent situations made it impractical to write a manual, and I didn\u2019t have the tim e or experience to do so regardless. Fortunately, someone did have the experi ence: the outsourced reps themselves. I sent one single e-mail to all the supervisors that immediately turned 200 e-mail per day into fewer than 20 e-mail per week: Hi All, I would like to establish a new polic y for my account that overrides all others. Keep the customer happy. If it is a problem that takes less than $100 to fix, use your judgment and fix it yourself. This is official written permission a nd a request to fix all problems that cost under $100 without c ontacting me. I am no l onger your customer; my customers are your customer. Don\u2019t ask me for permission. Do what you think is", "right, and we\u2019ll ma ke adjustments as we go along. Thank you, Tim Upon close analysis, it became clear that more than 90% of the issues that prompted e-mail could be resolved for less than $20. I reviewed the financ ial results of their independent decision-making on a weekly basis for four weeks, then a monthly basis, and then on a quarterly basis.", "It\u2019s amazing how someone\u2019s IQ seems to double as soon as y o u g i v e t h e m responsibility and indicate that you trus t them. The first mont h cost perhaps $200 more than if I had been micromanaging. In the meantime, I saved more than 100 hours of my own time per month, customers receiv ed faster service, returns dropped to less than 3% (the industry average is 10\u201315 %), and outsourcers spent less time on my account, all of which resulted in rapid gr owth, higher profit margins, and happier people on all sides. People are smarter than you think. Give them a chance to prove themselves. If you are a micromanaged employee, have a heart-to-heart with your boss and explain that you want to be more productive a nd interrupt him or her less. \u201cI hate that I have to interrupt you so mu ch and pull you away from mo re important things I know you have on your plate. I was doing some reading and had some thoughts on how I might be more productive. Do you have a second?\u201d Before this conversation, develop a number o f \u201c r", "u l e s \u201d l i k e t h e p r e v i o u s e x a m p l e that would allow you to work more aut onomously with less a pproval-seeking. The boss can review the outcome of your decisions on a daily or weekly basis in the initial stages. Suggest a one-week trial and end with \u201cI\u2019d like to try it. Does that sound like something we could try for a week?\u201d or my personal favorite, \u201cI s that reasonable?\u201d It\u2019s hard for people to la bel things unreasonable. Realize that bosses are supervisors, not slave masters. Establish yourself as a consistent challenger of the status quo and most people will learn to avoid challenging you, particularly if it is in the interest of hi gher per-hour productivity. If you are a micromanaging entrepreneur, r ealize that even if you can do something better than the rest of the wo rld, it doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what you should be doing if it\u2019s part of the minutiae. Empower othe rs to act without interrupting you. SET THE RULES in your favor: Limit access to your tim e, force people to define", "their requests before spending time with them, a nd batch routine menial tasks to prevent postponement of more important projects. Do not let people interrupt you. Find your focus and you\u2019ll find your lifestyle. The bottom line is that you only have the rights you fight for. In the next section, Automation , we\u2019ll see how the New Rich create management- free money and eliminate the largest remaining obstacle of all: themselves. Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS People think it must be fun to be a s uper genius, but they don\u2019t realize how hard it is to put up with a ll the idiots in the world. \u2014CALVIN , from Calvin and Hobbes B laming idiots for interruptions is like bl aming clowns for scaring children\u2014they can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s their nature. Then again, I had (who am I kidding\u2014and have), on", "occasion, been known to create interruptions out of thin air. If you\u2019re anything like me, that makes us both occasional idiots. L earn to recognize and fight the interruption impulse. This is infinitely easier when you have a set of rules, respons es, and routines to follow. It is your job to prevent yourself and others from letting the unnecessary and unimportant prevent the start-to-finish completion of the important. This chapter differs from the previous in that the necessary actions, due to the inclusion of examples and templates, have b e e n p r e s e n t e d t h r o u g h o u t f r o m s t a r t t o finish. This Q & A will thus be a summary ra ther than a repetition. The devil is in the details, so be sure to reread this chapter for the specifics. The 50,000-foot review is as follows: 1. Create systems to limit your availabilit y via e-mail and phone and deflect inappropriate contact . Get the autoresponse and voicemail script i n p l a c e n o w , a n d m a s", "t e r t h e v a r i o u s methods of evasion. Replace the habit of \u201cH ow are you?\u201d with \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Get specific and remember\u2014no stories. Focu s on immediate actions . Set and practice interruption-kill ing policies. Avoid meetings whenever possible: \uf0b7 Use e-mail instead of face-to-face meetings to solve problems. \uf0b7 Beg-off going (this can be accomplished through the Puppy Dog Close). \uf0b7 If meetings are unavoidable, keep the following in mind: \uf0b7 Go in with a clear set of objectives. \uf0b7 Set an end time or leave early. 2. Batch activities to limit setup cost a n d p r o v i d e m o r e t i me for dreamline milestones . What can I routinize by batching? That is , what tasks (whether l a u n d r y , g r o c e r i e s , mail, payments, or sales reporting, for example) can I allot to a specific time each day, week, month, quarter, or year so that I don \u2019t squander time repeating them more often than is absolutely necessary? 3. Set or request autonomous rules", "and guidelines with occasional review of results . Eliminate the decision bottleneck for all things that are nonfatal if misperformed. If an employee, believe in yourself enough to as k for more independence on a trial basis. Have practical \u201crules\u201d prepared and ask th e boss for the sale after surprising him or", "her with an impromptu presentation. Reme mber the Puppy Dog Close\u2014make it a one- time trial and reversible. For the entrepreneur or manager, give ot hers the chance to prove themselves. The likelihood of irreversible or expensive probl ems is minimal and the time savings are guaranteed. Remember, profit is only profitabl e to the extent that you can use it. For that you need time. TOOLS AND TRICKS Eliminating Paper Distractions, Capturing Everything Evernote ( www.evernote.com ) This is perhaps the most impressive tool I\u2019ve found in the last year, introduced to me by some of the most productive technologist s in the world. Evernote has eliminated more than 90% of the paper in my life and eliminated nearly all of the multiple tabs I used to leave open in web browsers, both of which distracted me to no end. It can clear out your entire office cl utter in one to three hours. Evernote allows you to easily capture info rmation from anywhere using whatever device is at hand, and everyt hing is then searchable (read : findable) from anywhere. I use it to: \uf0b7 Take photographs of everything I might want to remember or find later\u2014business cards,", "handwritten notes, wine labels, receipts, whiteboard sessions, and more. Evernote identifies the text in all of these pictures automatically, so it\u2019s all searchable(!), whether from an iPhone, your laptop, or the web. Just as one example, I can store and find the contact information from any business card in seconds (often using the built in iSight camera on Mac to capture it), rather than spending hours inputting it all into contacts or searching through e-mail for that lost phone number. It\u2019s mind-numbing how much time this saves. \uf0b7 Scan all agreements, paper articles, etc., that would otherwise sit in file folders or on my desk. I use the Mac Fujitsu ScanSnap miniscanner (", "http://bit.ly/scansnapmac ), the best I\u2019ve found, which scans all of it directly to Evernote in seconds with one button. \uf0b7 Take snapshots of websites, capturing all text and links, so that I can read them offline when traveling or doing later research. Get rid of all those scattered bookmarks, favorites, and open tabs. Screening and Avoiding Unwanted Calls GrandCentral ( www.grandcentral.com ) and YouMail ( www.youmail.com ) In a world where your physical address will change more often th an your cell phone number (and e-mail), it can be disastrous if your number be comes public or gets in the wrong hands. Enter GrandCentral, which will gi ve you a number with the area code of your choosing that then forw ards to your own phone(s). I now give a GrandCentral number to anyone besides family and cl ose friends. Some of the benefits: \uf0b7 Identify any incoming number as unwanted, and that caller will then hear a \u201cnumber not in service\u201d message when attempting to call you. \uf0b7 Customize your voicemail message to individual callers (spouse, boss, colleague, client, etc.) and listen in on messages as they\u2019re being left, so you can \u201cpick up\u201d if the message is worth", "the interruption. Call recording is also an option. \uf0b7 Use an area code outside of your hometown to prevent people and companies from finding and misusing addresses you\u2019d prefer to keep private. \uf0b7 Establish do-not-disturb hours, when calls are routed directly to voicemail with no ring. \uf0b7 Have voicemail sent to your cell phone as SMS (text messages).", "YouMail, another option, can also transcribe voicema ils and send them to your phone as text messages. Getting calls whil e stuck in a time-wasting meeting? No problem: Respond to voicemails via SMS dur ing the meeting so you\u2019re not stuck returning calls afterward. One Shot, One Kill Scheduling Without E-mail Back-and-Forth Few things are as time-consuming as sche duling via e-mail. Person A: \u201cHow about Tues. at 3 P.M.?\u201d Person B: \u201cI can make it.\u201d Pers on C: \u201cI have a meeting. How about Thurs.?\u201d Person D: \u201cI\u2019m on a con-call. How about 10 A.M. on Fri.?\u201d Use these tools to make scheduling simple and fast instead of another part-time job. Doodle ( www.doodle.com ) The best free tool I\u2019ve found for herding cats (multiple people) for scheduling without excessive e-mail. Create and poll in 30 seconds with the proposed options and forward a link to everyone invited. Check back a fe w hours later and you\u2019ll have the best time for the most people. TimeDriver ( www.timedriver.com ) Let colleagues and clients self-schedule w ith you based on your availability, which is determined by integration w ith Outlook or Google Calenda r. Embed a \u201cschedule now\u201d button in", "e-mail messages and you\u2019ll never ha ve to tell people when you can make a call or meeting. Let them see what\u2019s open and choose. Choosing the Best E-mail Batching Times Xobni ( www.xobni.com/special ) Xobni\u2014 inbox spelled backwards\u2014is a free program for putting Outlook on steroids. It offers many features, but th e most relevant to this chapter is its ability to identify \u201chotspots,\u201d or periods of time when you re ceive the bulk of e-mail from your most important contacts. These \u201chotspots\u201d are ba tching times that will enable you to keep critical contacts (clients, bosses, etc.) smiling even while you reduce checking e-mail to 1\u20133 times per day. It will also populate your contacts automatically by pulling phone numbers, addresses, etc., from separate e-mail buried in the inbox. E-mailing Without Entering th e Black Hole of the Inbox Don\u2019t enter the black hole of the inbox of f hours because you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll forget something. Use these services instead to keep focused, whether on completing a critical project or simp ly enjoying the weekend. Jott ( www.jott.com )", "Capture thoughts, create to- do\u2019s, and set reminders with a simple toll-free phone call. The service transcribes your message (15\u201330 seconds) and e-mails it to whomever you want, including yourself, or to your Googl e calendar for automatic scheduling. Jott also enables you to post voice message links to Twitter ( www.twitter.com ), Facebook (www.facebook.com ), and other services that tend to consume hours if you visit the sites themselves. Copy talk ( www.copytalk.com ) Dictate any message up to four minutes a nd have the transcription e-mailed to you within hours. Excellent for brainstorming, and the accuracy is astounding. Preventing Web Browsing Completely Freedom ( http://www.ibiblio.o rg/fred/freedom/ ) Freedom is a free application that disabl es networking on an Apple computer for 1\u2013 480 mintues (up to eight hours) at a time. Freedom will free you from the distractions of the Internet, allo wing you the focus to get real work done. Freedom enforces freedom; a reboot is the only method for turning Freedom off before the time limit you\u2019ve set for your self. The hassle of rebooting means you\u2019re less likely to cheat, and you\u2019ll be more productive. Experiment with the software for short periods of time at", "first (30\u201360 minutes.) COMFORT CHALLENGE Revisit the Terrible Twos (2 Days) For the next two days, do as all good two-year-olds do and say \u201cno\u201d to all requests. Don\u2019t be selective. Refuse to do all thi ngs that won\u2019t get you immediately fired. Be selfish. As with the last exercise, the objective isn\u2019t an outcome\u2014in this case, eliminating just those things that waste time\u2014but the process: getting comfortable with saying \u201cno.\u201d Potential questions to decline include the following: Do you have a minute? Want to see a movie tonight/tomorrow? Can you help me with X? \u201cNo\u201d should be your default answer to all requests. Don\u2019t make up elaborate lies or you\u2019ll get called on them. A simple \u201cI really can\u2019t\u2014sorry; I\u2019ve got too much on my plate right now\u201d will do as a catch-all response. LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION Batching tool\u2014PO Box: This might be stating the obvious, but one easy way to encourage batching of your mail is to use a PO Box versus getting mail delivered to your house. We got our PO Box to limit access to our physical address online, but it", "also encourages you to get the mail less and deal with it in batch. Our post office has recycling bins, so at least 60% of the ma il doesn\u2019t even come home with us. For a while I was only getting and managing the mail once a week, and I found not only did it take less time overall, I did a better job managing it and getting it out of the way versus looking at it and sett ing it aside for future follow up. \u2014LAURA TURNER For families, the four-hour workweek doesn\u2019t have to mean four months on a sailboat in the Caribbean unless that\u2019s their dr eam, but even the simple ideal of having time to take a walk in the park every evening or spending weekends together, makes taking actions to implement this program worthwhile.

I would be assisting you in your editorial and personal job\u2026. I would try to adapt myself as per your requirem ents that would lead to desired satisfaction. Desired satisfaction. This is great. Back when I worked at an offi ce, I had assistants, but there was never any talk of desired satisfaction . In fact, if anyone ever used the phrase \u201cdesired satisfaction,\u201d we\u2019d all end up in a solemn meeting with HR. I GO OUT to dinner with my friend Misha, who grew up in India, founded a software firm, and subsequently became nauseati ngly rich. I tell him about Operation Outsource. \u201cYou should call Your Man in India,\u201d he says. Misha explains that this is a company for Indian businessmen who have moved overseas but who still have parents back in New Delhi or Mumbai. YMII is their overseas concierge service\u2014it buys movie tickets and cell phones and other sundries", "for abandoned moms. Perfect. This could kick my outsourcing up to a new level.

Happily, YMII likes the idea, and just like that th e support team at Jacobs Inc. has doubled.

If you\u2019re a man, you take it. \u2014MALCOLM X , Malcolm X Speaks G etting a remote personal assistant is a huge departure point and marks the moment that you learn how to give orde rs and be commander instead of the commanded. It is small-scale training wheels for the most critical of NR skills: remote management and communication. It is time to learn how to be the boss. It isn\u2019t time-consuming. It\u2019s low-cost and it\u2019s low-risk. Whether or not you \u201cneed\u201d someone at this point is immaterial. It is an exercise. It is also a litmus test for entreprene urship: Can you manage (direct and chastise) other people? Given the proper instruct ion and practice, I believe so. Most entrepreneurs fail because they jump into the deep end of the pool without learning to swim first. Using a virtual as sistant (VA) as a simple exercise with no downside, the basics of management are covered in a 2\u20134-week test costi ng between $100\u2013400.

Becoming a member of the NR is not just about work ing smarter. It\u2019s about building a system to replace yourself. This is the first exercise. Even if you have no intention of becoming an entrepreneur, this is the ultimate continuation of our 80/20 and elimination process: Preparing someone to replace you (even if it never happens) wi ll produce an ultrarefined set of rules that will cut remaining fat and redundancy from your sc hedule. Lingering unimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them. But what about the cost? This is a hurdle that is hard for most. If I can do it better than an ass i stant, why should I pay them at all? Because the goal is to free your time to focus on bigger and better things . This chapter is a low-cost exercise to get you past this lifestyle limiter. It is absolutely necessary that you realize that you can always do something more cheaply yourself. This doesn\u2019t mean you want to spend your time doing it. If you spend", "your time, worth $20\u201325 per hour, doing something th at someone else will do for $10 per hour, it\u2019s simply a poor use of resources. It is important to take baby steps toward paying others to do work for you. Few do it, which is another reason so few people have their ideal lifestyles. Even if the cost is occasionally more pe r hour than you currently earn, the trade is often worth it. Let\u2019s assume you make $50,000 and thus $25 per hour (working from", "9\u20135, Monday through Friday, for 50 weeks per yea r).

S econd, you can delegate business tasks that don\u2019t include financial informa tion or identify your company. Ready to build an army of a ssistants? Let\u2019s first look at the dark side of delegation. A review is in order to prevent abus es of power and wasteful behavior. Delegation Dangers: Before Getting Started The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnif y the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency. \u2014BILL GATES H ave you ever been given illogical assi gnments, handed unimportant work, or commanded to do something in the most ine fficient fashion possible? Not fun and not productive. Now it\u2019s your turn to show that you know better. Delega tion is to be used as a further step in reduction, not as an excuse to create more movement and add the unimportant. Remember\u2014unless something is well-defined and important, no one should do it. Eliminate before you delegate. Never automate something that can be e liminated, and never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined. Ot herwise,", "you waste someone else\u2019s time instead of your own, which now wastes your hard-earned cash. How\u2019s that for incentive to be effective and efficient? Now you\u2019re playing with your own dough. It\u2019s something I want you to get comfortable w ith, and this baby step is small stakes. Did I mention to eliminate before you delegate? For example, it is popular among executives to have assistants read e-mail. In some cases this is valuable. In my case, I use spam filters, autoresponders with FAQs, and automatic forwarding to outsourcers to limit my e-mail obligation to 10\u201320 e-mail", "responses per week. It takes me 30 minut es per week because I used systems\u2014 elimination and automation\u2014to make it so. Nor do I use an assistant to set meetings a n d c o n f e r e n c e c a l l s b e c a u s e I h a v e eliminated meetings. If I need to set the odd 20-minute call for a given month, I\u2019ll send one two-sentence e-mail and be done with it. Principle number one is to refine rules and processes before adding people. Using people to leverage a refined process multiplies production; us ing people as a solution to a poor process multiplies problems. The Menu: A World of Possibilities I am not interested in picking up cr umbs of compassion thrown from the table of someone who considers himsel f my master. I want the full menu of rights. \u2014BISHOP DESMOND TUTU, South African cleric and activist The next question then becomes, \u201cWhat should you delegate?\u201d It\u2019s a good question, but I don\u2019t want to an swer it. I want to watch Family Guy . The truth be told, it is a he ll of", "a lot of work writing a bout not working. Ritika of Brickwork and Venky of YMII are more than capable of writing this section, so I\u2019ll just mention two guidelines and leave the me ntal hernia of detail work to them. Golden Rule #1: Each delegated task must be both time-consuming and well- defined . If you\u2019re running around like a chicken with its head cut off and assign your VA to do that for you, it doesn\u2019t improve the order of the universe. Golden Rule #2: O n a l i g h t e r n o t e , h a v e s o m e fun with it. Have someone in Bangalore or Shanghai send e-mails to fr iends as your personal concierge to set lunch dates or similar ba sics. Harass your boss with o d d p h o n e c a l l s i n s t r o n g accents from unknown numbers. Being effectiv e doesn\u2019t mean being serious all the time. It\u2019s fun being in control for a change. Get a bit of repression off your chest so it doesn\u2019t turn into a complex later. Getting", "Personal and Going Howard Hughes Howard Hughes, the ultrarich filmmaker and eccentric from The Aviator , was notorious for assigning odd tasks to his a ssistants. Here are a few from Donald Bartlett\u2019s Howard Hughes: His Life and Madness you might want to consider. 1. After his first plane crash, Hughes confid ed in a friend that he believed his recovery was due to his consumption of or ange juice and its healing properties. He", "believed that exposure to the air diluted the juice\u2019s potency, so he demanded that fresh oranges be sliced and juiced in front of him. 2. When Hughes was partaking of the ni ghtlife in Las Vegas, his aides were charged with approaching any girls he took a liking to. If a girl was invited to join the Hughes table and agreed, an aide woul d pull out a waiver and agreement for her to sign. 3. Hughes had a barber on call 24/7 but had his hair and nails trimmed about once a year. 4. In his hotel-bound years, Hughes was rumore d to have instruct ed assistants to place a single cheeseburger in a specific tree outside his penthouse room at a 4:00 P.M. each day, whether he was there or not. Such a world of possibilitie s! Just as the Model-T br ought transportation to the masses, virtual assistants bring eccentric billionaire behavior within reach of each man, woman, and child. Now, that\u2019s progress. W ithout further ado, let me pass the mic. Note that YMII performs both personal and business tasks, whereas Brickwork focuse s solely on business projects. Let\u2019s start with the important but dull stuff", "and move qui ckly from the sublime to the ridiculous. To give a true taste of what to exp ect, I have not corrected non-native-sounding English.

There are tens of thousands of VAs\u2014how on earth do you find the right one? The resources at the end of this chapter will show you where to look, but it is overwhelming and confusing unless you have a few criteria determined in advance. It often helps to begin with the question \u201cWhere on Earth?\u201d Remote or Local? \u201cMade in the USA\u201d doesn\u2019t have the ring it used to. The pros of jumping time zones and visiting third-world currency are twof old: People work while you sleep, and the per-hour expense is less. Time", "savings and cost savings. Ritika explains the former with an example.", "One can give the remote personal assistant in India their assignment when they are leaving work at the end of the day in New York City, and they will have the presentation ready the next morning. Becau se of the time difference with India, assistants can work on it while they are as leep and have it b ack in their morning. When they wake up, they will find th e completed summary in their inbox. These assistants can also help them keep pace w ith what they want to read, for example. Indian and Chinese VAs, as well as most from other developing countries, will run $4\u201315 per hour, the lower end being limited to simple tasks and the higher end including the equivalent of Harvard or Stanford M.B.A.s and Ph.D.s. Need a business plan to raise funding? Brickwork can provide it for between $2,500\u20135,000 instead of $15,000\u201320,000. Foreign assistance isn\u2019t just for th e small time. I know from firsthand discussions that executives from big fi ve accounting and management consulting firms routinely charge clients six figures for research reports that are then farmed to India for low four figures. In the U.S. or Canada, the per-hour range", "is often $25\u2013100. Seems like an obvious choice, right? Bangalore 100%? It\u2019s not. The important metric is cost per completed task, not cost per hour. The biggest challenge with overseas help will be the language barrier, which often quadruples back-and-forth discussion and the ultimate cost. The first time I hired an Indian VA, I made the fundamental mistake of not setting an hour cap for three simple tasks. I checked in later th at week and found he had spen t 23 hours chasing his tail. He had scheduled one tentative interview for the following week, set at the wrong time! Mind boggling. 23 hours? It ended up costin g me, at $10 per hour, $230. The same tasks, assigned later that week to a nativ e English speaker in Canada, were completed in two hours at $25 per hour. $50 for more than four times the results. That said, I later requested another Indian VA from the same firm who was able to duplicate the native speaker results. How do you know which to choose? That\u2019s the beautiful part: You don\u2019t. It\u2019s a matter of testing a few assistants to both sharpen your communication skills and determine who is", "worth hiring and who is worth firing. Being a results-based boss isn\u2019t as simple as it looks. There are a number of less ons to be learned here. First, per-hour cost is not the ultimate de terminant of cost. Look at per-task cost. If you need to spend time restating the task and otherwise managing the VA, determine the time required of you and add this (usi ng your per-hour rate fr om earlier chapters) to the end sticker price of the task. It can be surprising. As cool as it is to say that you have people working for you in three countri es, it\u2019s uncool to spend time babysitting people who are supposed to make your life easier. Second, the proof is in the pudding. It is impossible to predict how well you will work with a given VA without a trial. Luck ily, there are things you can do to improve your odds, and one of them is using a VA firm instead of a solo operator.", "Solo vs. Support Team Let\u2019s suppose you find the perfect VA. He or she is performing all of your noncritical tasks and you\u2019ve decided to take a much-d eserved vacation to Thailand. It\u2019s nice to know someone besides you will be manning the wheel and putting out fires for a change. Finally, some relief! Two hours before your flight from Bangkok to Phuket, you receive an e-mail: Your VA is out of co mmission and will be in the hospital for the next week. Not good. Vacation FUBAR. I don\u2019t like being dependent on one person, a nd I don\u2019t recommend it in the least. In the world of high technology, this type of d e p e n d e n c y w o u l d b e r e f e r r e d t o a s a \u201csingle point of failure\u201d\u2014one fragile item upon which all else depends.

In the context of VAs, redundancy entails having fallback support. I", "recommend that you hire a VA firm or VAs w i t h b a c k u p t e a m s i n s t e a d o f s o l e operators. Examples abound, of course, of pe ople who have had a single assistant for decades without incident, but I suggest that this is the exception rather than the rule. Better safe than sorry. Besides simple disa ster avoidance, a gr oup structure provides a pool of talent that allows you to assign mu ltiple tasks without bothering to find a new person with the qualifications. Brickwork and YMII both exemplify this type of structure and provide a singl e point of contact, a persona l account manager, who then farms out your tasks to the most-capable people in the group and across different shifts. Need graphic design ? Covered. Need database management? Covered. I don\u2019t like calling and coordinating multiple people. I want one-stop shopping and am willing to pay 10% more to have it. I encourage you to be similarly pound-wise and penny-foolish. Team preference doesn\u2019t mean that bigger is better, just that multiple people are better than one person. The", "best VA I have used to date is an Indian with five backup assistants under him. Three can be more th an sufficient, but two is toeing the line. The #1 Fear: \u201cSweetheart, Did You Buy a Porsche in China?\u201d I\u2019m sure you might have your fears. AJ certainly did: My outsourcers now know an alarming amou nt about me\u2014not just my schedule but my cholesterol, my infertility problems, my Social Security number, my passwords (including the one that is a particularly adolescent curse word). Sometimes I worry that I can\u2019t piss off my outsourcers or I\u2019ll end up with a $12,000 charge on my MasterCard bill from the Louis Vuitton in Anantapur.", "The good news is that misuse of financial and confidential information is rare. In all of the interviews I conducted for this secti on, I could find only one case of information abuse, and I had to search long and hard. It involved an overworked U.S.-based VA who hired freelance help at the last moment. Commit to memory the following\u2014never use the new hire. Prohibit small-operation VAs from subcontracting work to unt ested freelancers without your written permission.

Still, information theft is best thought of as inevitable in a d i g i t a l w o r l d , a n d precautions should be taken with damage c ontrol in mind. There are two rules that I use to minimize damage and allow for fast repair. 1. Never use debit cards for on line transactions or with remote assistants. Reversing unauthorized credit card charges, particular ly with American Express, is painless and near instantaneous. Recovering funds w ithdrawn from your checking account via unauthorized debit card use takes dozens of hours in paperwork alone and can take months to receive, if approved at all. 2. If your VA will be accessing websites on your behalf, create a new unique login and password to be used on those sites. Most of us reuse both logins and passwords on multiple sites, and taking this precaution lim its possible damage. Instruct them to use these unique logins to create accounts on new sites if needed. Note that this is particularly important when using assist ants who", "have access to live commercial websites (developers, programmers, etc.). If information or identity theft hasn\u2019t h i t y o u , i t w i l l . U s e t h e s e g u i d e l i n e s a n d you\u2019ll realize when it happens that, just like most nightmar es, it\u2019s not that big a deal and is reversible. The Complicated Art of Simplicity: Common Complaints M y assistant is an idiot! It took him 23 hours to book an interview! This was the first complaint I had, for sure. 23 hours!

Find the name, e-mail, and phone (phone is least important) of workers in the U.S. who have negotiated remote wo rk agreements (telecommuting) despite resistant bosses. Those who have travel ed outside the U.S. are ideal.

If you are an effective person but unaccustomed to issuing commands, assume that most proble ms at the outset are your fault. It is tempting to immediately point the finger at someone else and huff and puff, but most beginner bosses repeat the same mistakes I made. 1. I accepted the first person the firm pr ovided and made no special requests at the outset . Request someone who has \u201cexcellent\u201d English and indicate that phone calls will be required (even if not). Be fast", "to reque st a replacement if there are repeated communication issues. 2. I gave imprecise directions . I asked him to schedule interv iews but didn\u2019t i ndicate that it was for an article. He assumed, based on work with previous clients, that I wanted to hire someone and he misspent time compiling spreadsheets and combing online job sites for additional information I didn\u2019t need. Sentences should have one possible interp retation and be suitable for a 2nd-grade reading level. This goes for native speakers as well and will make requests clearer. Ten-dollar words disguise imprecision. Note that I asked him to respond if he didn\u2019t understand or had questions. This is the wrong approach. Ask foreign VAs to rephrase tasks to confirm understanding before getting started. 3. I gave him a license to waste time . This brings us again to damage control. Request a status update after a few hours of work on a task to ensure that the task is both understood and achievable. Some tasks are, after initial attempts, impossible. 4. I set the deadline a week in advance .", "Use Parkinson\u2019s Law and assign tasks that are to be completed within no more than 72 hours. I have had the best luck with 48 and 24 hours. This is another compelling reason to use a small group (three or more) rather than a single individual who can become overtaxed with last-minute requests from multiple clients. Using short deadlines does not mean avoidi ng larger tasks (e. g., business plan), bu t rather breaking them into smaller milestones that can be completed in shorter time frames (outline, competitive research summaries, chapters, etc.). 5. I gave him too many tasks and di dn\u2019t set an order of importance . I advise sending one task at a time whenev er possible and no more than two. If you want to cause your computer to hang or crash, open 20 windows a nd applications at the same time. If you want to do the same to your assistant, assign him or her a dozen tasks without prioritizing th em. Recall our mantra: Eliminate before you delegate. WHAT DOES A good VA task e-mail look like?

Start small but think big . Tina Forsyth, an online business manager (higher-level VA) who helps six-figure- income clients achieve", "seven figures w ith business model redesigns, makes the following recommendations. \uf0b7 Look at your to-do list\u2014what has been sitting on it the longest?", "\uf0b7 Each time you are interrupted or change tasks, ask, \u201cCould a VA do this?\u201d \uf0b7 Examine pain points\u2014what causes you the most frustration and boredom?

Let go of the controls a bit. Don\u2019t assign crap tasks that end up consuming rather than saving time. It makes little sense to spend 10\u201315 minutes sending an e-mail to India to get a price quote on a plane ticket when you could do the same online in 10 minutes and avoid all the subsequent back-and-forth. Push outside your comfort zone\u2014that is the entire point of the exercise. It is always possible to r eclaim a task for yourself if the VA proves incapable, so test the limits of their ca pabilities. Remember Brickw ork\u2019s suggestion: Don\u2019t limit", "yourself. 3. Identify your top five time-consuming no n-work tasks and fi ve personal tasks you could assign for sheer fun . 4. Keep in sync: scheduling and calendars . If you decide to have an assistant sche dule appointments and add things to your calendar, it will be important to ensure wh at you both see is updated. There are several options: BusySync (www.busysync.com ) I have two Gmail accounts: one private account for me and one for my assistant, where gene ral e-mail is sent. I use BusySync to", "synchronize her Google Calendar with iCal (M ac calendar) on my laptop. I have also used SpanningSync (www.spanningsync.com ) successfully for the same purpose.

I suggest you compare this to synchronizing your Outlook with an assistant\u2019s Google Calendar.

Rather than avoid the topic out of fear of confrontation, let\u2019s chocolate-coat it and ask them to fix it.

First things first: coff ee. The jet lag was minor, considering he had just returned from a two- week jaunt through the islands of Croatia. It was just one of six countries he had visited in the la st 12 months. Japan was next on the agenda. Buzzing with a smile and his coffee mug in hand, he ambled over to his Mac to check on personal e-mail first. There we re 32 messages and all brought good news. One of his friends and business partners , also a cofounder of Limewire, had an update: Last Bamboo, their start-up poised to reinvent peer-to-peer technology, was rounding the final corners of development. It could be their billion-dollar baby, but Doug was letting the engineers run wild first. Samson Projects, one of the hottest c ontemporary art galleries in Boston, had compliments for Doug\u2019s latest work and requests for expanded involvement with new exhibits as their sound curator. The last e-mail in his inbox was a fan lette r addressed to \u201cDemon Doc\u201d and praise for his latest instrumental hip-hop album, onliness VI.O.I", ". Doug had released his album as what he termed \u201copen source music\u201d \u2014anyone could download the album for free and use sounds from any track in his or her own compositions. He smiled again, polished off his dark ro ast, and opened a window to deal with business e-mail next. It would take much le ss time. In fact, less than 30 minutes for the day and 2 hours for the week. How much things change. Two years earlier, in June of 2004, I wa s in Doug\u2019s apartment checking e-mail for what I hoped would be the last time for a long time. I was headed to JFK Airport in New York in a matter of hours and was prep aring for an indefi nite quest around the world. Doug looked on with amusement.

The prospect orders a product for $325 (the average purchase price, though prices range from $29\u20137,500) on a Yahoo s hopping cart, and a PDF with all their billing and shipping information is automatically e-mailed to Doug. 3.

If we subtract 1% of the full retail price (1% of $325 = $3.25) for the Yahoo Store transaction fee and 2.5% for the credit card processing fee (2.5% of $325 = $8.13), Doug is left with a pretax profit of $167.38 for this one sale.

Why to Begin with the End in Mind: A Cautionary Tale Sarah is excited. It has been two weeks since her line of humorous T-shirts for golfers went online, and she is averaging 5 T-shirt sales per day at $15 each. Her cost per unit is $5, so she is grossing $50 in profit (minus 3% in cr edit card fees) per 24 hours, as she passes shipping and handling on to customers. She should soon recoup the cost of her initial order of 300 shirts (including plate charge s, setup, etc.)\u2014but wa nts to earn more.", "It\u2019s a nice reversal of fortune, consideri ng the fate of her first product. She had spent $12,000 to develop, patent , and manufacture a high-tech stroller for new moms (she has never been a new mom), only to find that no one was interested. The T-shirts, in contrast, were actually selling, but sales were beginning to slow. It appears she has reached her online sales ceiling, as well-funded and uneducated competitors are now spending too much for a dvertising and driving up costs. Then it strikes her\u2014retail! Sarah approaches the manager of he r local golf shop, Bill, who immediately expresses interest in carrying the shirts. She\u2019s thrilled. Bill asks for the customary 40% minimum discount for wholesale pricing. This means her sell price is now $9 instead of $15 and her profit has dropped from $10 to $4. Sarah decides to give it a shot and doe s the same with three other stores in surrounding towns. The shirts begin to move o ff the shelves, but she soon realizes that her small profit is being eaten by extra hours she sp ends handling invoices and additional administration. She decides to approach a distributor23 to alleviate this labor,", "a company that acts as a shipping warehouse and sells products from v a r i o u s m a n u f a c t u r e r s t o g o l f s t o r e s nationwide. The distributor is i n t e r e s t e d a n d a s k s f o r i t s usual pricing\u201470% off of retail or $4.50\u2014which would leave Sarah 50 cents in the hole on each unit. She declines. To make matters worse, the four local st ores have already started discounting her shirts to compete among one another and are killing their own profit margins. Two weeks later, reorders disappear. Sarah aba ndons retail and retu rns to her website demoralized. Sales online have dropped to almost nothing with new competition. She has not recouped her initial investment, and she still ha s 50 shirts in her garage. Not good. It all could have been prevente d with proper testing and planning. ED \u201cM R. CREATINE \u201d BYRD is no Sarah. He does not invest and hope for the best. His San Francisco\u2013based company, MRI, had the", "top-selling sports supplement in the U.S. from 2002\u20132005, NO 2. It is still a top-seller despite dozens of imitators. He did it through smart testing, smart positioning, and brilliant distribution. Prior to manufacturing, MRI first offered a low-priced book related to the product through \u00bc-page advertisements in men\u2019s h ealth magazines. Once the need had been confirmed with a mountain of book orders, NO 2 was priced at an outrageous $79.95, positioned as the premium product on the market, and sold exclusively through GNC stores nationwide. No one else was permitted to sell it. How can it make sense to turn away business? There are a few good reasons. First, the more competing resellers there are, the faster your product goes extinct. This was one of Sarah\u2019s mistakes. It works like this: Reseller A sells the product for your recommended advertised price of $50, then reseller B sells it for $45 to compete with A, and then C sells it for", "$40 to compete with A and B. In no time at all, no one is making profit from selling your product and reorders disappear. Custom ers are now accustomed to the lower pricing and the process is ir reversible. The product is de ad and you need to create a new product. This is precisely the reason w hy so many companies need to create new product after new product month after month. It\u2019s a headache. I had one single supplement, BrainQUICK EN\u00ae (also sold as BodyQUICK\u00ae) for six years and maintained a consistent prof it margin by limiting w holesale distribution, particularly online, to the top one or tw o largest resellers who could move serious quantities of product and who agreed to maintain a minimum advertised pricing.24 Otherwise, rogue discounters on eBay and mom-and-pop independents will drive you broke. Second, if you offer someone exclusivity, wh ich most manufacturers try to avoid, it can work in your favor. Since you are offe ring one company 100% of the distribution, it is possible to negotiate better profit ma rgins (offering less of a discount off of retail price), better marketing support in-store, faster payment, and other preferential treatment. It", "is critical that you decide how you will sell and distribute your product before you commit to a product in the first place. Th e more middlemen are involved, the higher your margins must be to maintain profita bility for all the li nks in the chain. Ed Byrd realized this an d exemplifies how doing the opposite of what most do can reduce risk and increase profit. Choosing distribution before product is just one example. Ed drives a Lamborghini down the Californi a coast when not traveling or in the office with his small focused staff and his tw o Australian shepherds. This outcome is not accidental. His product-creation met hods\u2014and those of the New Rich in general\u2014can be emulated. Here\u2019s how you do it in the fewest number of steps. Step One: Pick an Affordably Reachable Niche Market When I was younger \u2026 I [didn\u2019t] want to be pigeonholed \u2026 Basically, now you want to be pigeonholed. It\u2019s your niche. \u2014JOAN CHEN , actress; appeared in The Last Emperor and Twin Peaks C reating demand is hard. Filling demand is much easier. Don\u2019t create a product, then seek someone to sell it to. Find a market\u2014define your customers\u2014then", "find or develop a product for them. I have been a student and an athlete, so I d e v e l o p e d p r o d u c t s f o r t h o s e m a r k e t s , focusing on the male demographic whenev er possible. The audiobook I created for", "college guidance counselors failed because I have never been a guidance counselor. I developed the subsequent speed-reading semi nar after realizing that I had free access to students, and the business succeeded because\u2014being a student myself\u2014I understood their needs and spending habits. Be a member of your target market and don\u2019t speculate what others need or will be willing to buy. Start Small, Think Big Some people are just into la vish dwarf entertainment. \u2013DANNY BLACK (42\u2033), part-owner of Shortdwarf.com25 Danny Black rents dwarfs as entertainment for $149 per hour. How is that for a niche market? It is said that if everyo ne is your customer, then no one is your customer. If you start off aiming to sell a product to dog- or car-lovers, stop. It\u2019s expensive to advertise to such a broad market, and you are compe ting with too many products and too much free information. If you focus on how to tr ain German shepherds or a restoration product for antique Fords, on the other ha nd, the market and competition shrink, making it less expensive to reach your cu stomers and easier to charge premium pricing. BrainQUICKEN was initially designed fo r students, but", "the market proved too scattered and difficult to reach. Based on po sitive feedback from student-athletes, I relaunched the product as BodyQUICK and test ed advertising in ma gazines specific to martial artists and powerlifters. These are mi nuscule markets compared to the massive student market, but not small. Low media co st and lack of competition enabled me to dominate with the fi rst \u201cneural accelerator\u201d26 in these niches. It is more profitable to be a big fish in a small pond than a small undefined fish in a big pond. How do you know if it\u2019s big enough to meet your TMI? Fo r a detailed real-lif e example of how I determined the market size of a recen t product, see \u201cMuse Math\u201d on this book\u2019s companion site. Ask yourself the following questions to find profitable niches. 1. Which social, industry, and professional groups do you belong to, have you belonged to, or do you understand, whet her dentists, engineers, rock climbers, recreational cyclists, car restoration aficionados, dancers, or other? Look creatively at your resume, work expe rience, physical habits, and hobbies and compile a list of all the groups, past and pr esent, that you can", "a ssociate yourself with. Look at products and books you own, include online and offline subscriptions, and ask yourself, \u201cWhat groups of people purchase th e same?\u201d Which magazines, websites, and newsletters do you read on a regular basis? 2. Which of the groups you identified have their own magazines?", "Visit a large bookstore such as Barnes & Noble and browse the magazine rack for smaller specialty magazines to brainstorm additional niches. There are literally thousands of occupation- and interest/hobby- specific magazines to choose from. Use Writer\u2019s Market t o i d e n t i f y m a g a z i n e o p t i o n s outside the bookstores. Narrow the groups from question 1 above to those that a r e r e a c h a b l e t h r o u g h o n e o r t w o s m a ll magazines. It\u2019s not important that thes e groups all have a lot of money (e.g., golfers)\u2014only that they spend money (ama teur athletes, bass fishermen, etc.) on products of some type. Call these magazines, speak to the advertising directors, and tell them that you are considering advert ising; ask them to e-mail their current advertising rate card and include both r eadership numbers and magazine back-issue samples. Search the back issues for repeat advertisers who sell direct-to-consumer via 800 numbers or websites\u2014the more repeat advertisers, and the more frequent their ads, the more", "profitable a magazine is for them \u2026 and will be for us. Step Two: Brainstorm (Do Not Invest In) Products Genius is only a superior power of seeing. \u2014JOHN RUSKIN, famed art and social critic Pick the two markets that you are most fam iliar with that have their own magazines with full-page advertising that costs le ss than $5,000. There shoul d be no fewer than 15,000 readers. This is the fun part. Now we get to br ainstorm or find products with these two markets in mind. The goal is come up with well-formed pr oduct ideas and spend nothing; in Step 3, we will create advertising for them and te st responses from real customers before investing in manufacturing. There are several criteria that ensure the end product will fit into an automated architecture. The Main Benefit Should Be En capsulated in One Sentence . People can dislike you\u2014and you often sell mo re by offending some\u2014but they should never misunderstand you. The main benefit of your product should be explainable in one sentence or phrase. How is it different and why should I buy it? ONE sentence or phrase, folks. Apple did an excellent job of", "this with the iPod. Instead of using the usual industry jargon with GB, bandwidth, and so forth, they simply said, \u201c1,000 songs in your pocket.\u201d Done deal. Keep it simple and do not move ah ead with a product until you can do this without confusing people. It Should Cost the Customer $50\u2013200 .", "The bulk of companies set prices in the midrange, and that is where the most competition is. Pricing low is shortsighted, because someone else is always willing to sacrifice more profit margin and drive you both bankrupt. Besides perceived value, there are three main benefits to creati ng a premium, high-e nd image and charging more than the competition. 1. Higher pricing means that we can sell fewer units\u2014and thus manage fewer customers\u2014and fulfill our dreamlines. It\u2019s faster. 2. Higher pricing attracts lower-mainten ance customers (better credit, fewer complaints/questions, fewer returns, etc. ). It\u2019s less headache. This is HUGE. 3. Higher pricing also creates highe r profit margins. It\u2019s safer. I personally aim for an 8\u201310x markup , which means a $100 product can\u2019t cost me more than $10\u201312.50.27 If I had used the commonly recommended 5 x markup with BrainQUICKEN, it would have gone bankrup t within 6 months due to a dishonest supplier and late magazine. The profit margin saved it, and within 12 months it was generating up to $80,000 per month. High has its limits, however. If the per-unit pr ice is above a certai n point, prospects need to speak to someone on the phone", "befo re they are comfortable enough to make the purchase. This is contraindi cated on our low-information diet. I have found that a price range of $50\u2013200 per sale provides the most profit for the least customer service hassle. Price high and then justify. It Should Take No More Than 3 to 4 Weeks to Manufacture . This is critically important for keeping costs low and adapting to sales demand without stockpiling product in advance. I will not pursue any product that takes more than three to four weeks to manufacture, a n d I r e c o m m e n d a i m i n g f o r o n e t o t w o weeks from order placement to shippable product. How do you know how long someth ing takes to manufacture? Contact contract manufacturers who specia lize in the type of products you\u2019re considering: http://www.thomasnet.com/ . Call a related manufa cturer (e.g., toilet bowls) if you need a referra l to a related manufacturer you cannot find (e.g., toilet cleaning solutions). Still no luck? Google different synonyms for your product in combination with \u201corganization\u201d and \u201cassoci ation\u201d to contact th e appropriate", "industry organizations. Ask them for referrals to co ntract manufacturers and for the names of their trade magazines, which often contain advertisements for contract manufacturers and related service providers we\u2019ll need for your virtual architecture later. Request pricing from the contract manufacturers to ensure the proper markup is possible. Determine the per-unit costs of pr oduction for 100, 500, 1,000, and 5,000 units. It Should Be Fully Explaina ble in a Good Online FAQ . Here is where I really screwed up in my product choice wi th Brain-QUICKEN.", "Even though ingestible s have enabled my NR l i f e , I w o u l d n o t w i s h t h e m o n anyone. Why not? You get 1,000 questions from every customer: Can I eat bananas with your product? Will it make me fart during dinner? On and on, ad nauseam. Choose a product that you can fully explain in a good online FAQ. If not, the task of travelling and otherwise forgetting about wo rk becomes very difficult or you end up spending a fortune on call center operators. Understanding these criteria , a question remains: \u201cHow does one obtain a good muse product that satisfies them?\u201d There are three options we\u2019ll cover in ascending order of recommendation. Option One: Resell a Product Purchasing an existing product at wholesale and reselling it is th e easiest route but also the least profitable. It is the fastest to set up but the fastest to die off due to price competition with other reselle rs. The profitable life span of each product is short unless an exclusivity agreement prevents ot hers from selling it. Reselling is, however, an excellent option fo", "r secondary back-end28 p r o d u c t s t h a t c a n b e s o l d t o e x i s t i n g customers or cross-sold29 to new customers online or on the phone. To purchase at wholesale, use these steps. 1. Contact the manufacturer and request a \u201cwholesale pricelist\u201d (generally 40% off retail) and terms. 2. If a business tax ID number is need ed, print out the proper forms from your state\u2019s Secretary of St ate website and file for an LLC (which I prefer) or similar protective busi ness structure for $100\u2013200. Do NOT purchase product until you have comple ted Step 3 in the next chapter. It is enough at this point to confirm the profit margin and have product photos and sales literature. That\u2019s reselling. Not much more to it. Option Two: License a Product I not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow. \u2014WOODROW WILSON", "Some of the world\u2019s best-known brands and products have been borrowed from someone or somewhere else. The basis for the energy drink Red Bull ca me from a tonic in Thailand, and the Smurfs were brought from Belgium. Pok\u00e9mon came from the land of Honda. The band KISS made millions in record and concert sales, but the real profit has been in licensing\u2014granting others the right to pr oduce hundreds of products with their name and image in exchange for a percentage of sales. There are two parties involve d in a licensing deal, and a member of the New Rich could be either. First, there is the inventor of the product,30 called the \u201clicensor,\u201d who can sell others the right to manufacture, us e, or sell his or her product, usually for 3\u2013 10% of the wholesale price (usually around 40% off retail) for each unit sold. Invent, let someone else do the rest, and cash checks. Not a bad model. The other side of the equation is the person interested in manufacturing and selling the inventor\u2019s product for 90\u201397% of the profit: the licensee. This is, for me and most NR, more interesting. Licensing is, however, dealmaking-intensiv e", "on both sides and a science unto itself. Creative contract negotiation is essential an d most readers will run into problems if it\u2019s their first product. For real-world case studies on both sides, ranging from Teddy Ruxpin to Tae-Bo, and full agreements w i t h a c t u a l d o l l a r a m o u n t s , v i s i t www.fourhourblog.com . From how to sell inventions w ithout prototypes or patents to how to secure rights to produc ts as a no-name beginner, it \u2019s all there. The economics are fascinating and the pr ofits can be astounding. In the meantime, we will focus on the l east complicated and most profitable option open to the most people: product creation. Option Three: Create a Product Creation is a better means of self-expr ession than possession; it is through creating, not possessing, th at life is revealed. \u2014VIDA D. SCUDDER , The Life of the Spirit in the Modern English Poets C reating a product is not complicated. \u201cC reate\u201d sounds more involved than it actually is. If the idea is a hard produc t\u2014an invention\u2014it is possible to", "hire mechanical engineers or i n d u s t r i a l d e s i g n e r s o n www.elance.com t o d e v e l o p a prototype based on your description of its function and appearance, which is then taken to a contract manufacturer. If you find a generic or stock product made by a contract manufacturer that can be re-purposed or positioned for a special market, it\u2019s even easier: Have them manufacture it, s tick a custom label on it for you, and presto\u2014 new product. This latter example is often re ferred to as \u201cprivate labeling.\u201d Have you", "ever seen a massage therapist\u2019s office with i t s o w n l i n e o f v i t a min products or the Kirkland brand at Costco? Private labeling in action. It is true that we\u2019ll be testing market response without manufacturing, but if the test is successful, manufacturing is t h e n e x t s t e p . T h i s m e a n s w e n e e d t o k e e p i n m i n d setup costs, per-unit costs, and order mi nimums. Innovative gadge ts and devices are great but often require speci al tooling, which makes the manufacturing start-up costs too expensive to meet our criteria. Putting mechanical devices aside and forgetting about welding and engineering, there is one class of product that meets a ll of our criteria, has a manufacturing lead time of less than a week in small quanti ties, and often permits n o t j u s t a n 8 \u2013 1 0 x markup, but a 20\u201350 x markup. No, not heroin or slave labor. Too much bribing and human interaction required. Information.", "Information products are low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to duplicate. Consider that th e top-selling non-information infomercial products\u2014whether exercise equipment or supplements\u2014have a useful life span of two to four months before imitators flood the market. I studied economics in Beijing for six months and observed firsthand how th e latest Nike sneaker or Callaway golf club could be duplicated and on eBay within a week of first appearing on shelves in the U.S. This is not an exaggeration, a nd I am not talking about a look-alike product\u2014 I mean an exact duplicate for 1/20 the cost. Information, on the other hand, is too time- consuming for most knockoff artists to bother with when there are eas ier products to replicate. It \u2019s easier to circumvent a patent than to paraphrase an entire course to avoid c opyright infringement. Three of the most successful television products of all time\u2014all of which have spent more than 300 weeks on the infomercial t op-10 bestseller lists\u2014reflect the competitive and profit margin advantage of information products. No Down Payment (Carlton Sheets) Attacking Anxiety and Depression (Lucinda Bassett) Personal Power (Tony Robbins) I know from conversations w ith the principal", "ow ners of one of the above products that more than $65 million worth of information moved through their doors in 2002. Their infrastructure consisted of fewer than 25 in-house operators, and the rest of the infrastructure, ranging from media pur chasing to shipping, was outsourced. Their annual revenue-per-employee is more than $2.7 million. Incredible. On the opposite end of the market size sp ectrum, I know a man who created a low- budget how-to DVD for less than $200 and sold it to owners of stor age facilities who wanted to install security systems. It\u2019s hard to get more ni che than that. In 2001, selling DVDs that cost $2 to duplicate for $95 apiece through trade magazines, he made several hundred thousand dollars with no employees.", "But I\u2019m Not an Expert! If you aren\u2019t an expert, don\u2019t sweat it. First, \u201cexpert\u201d in the context of selling product means that you know more about the topic than the purchaser. No more. It is not necessary to be the best\u2014just better than a small target number of your prospective cu stomers. Let\u2019s suppose that your current dreamline\u2014to compete in the 1,150-mile I d i t a r o d d o g s l e d d i n g r a c e i n A l a s k a \u2014 requires $5,000 to realize. If there are 15,000 readers and even 50 (0.33%) can be convinced of your superior expertise in skill X and spend $100 for a program that teaches it, that is $5,000. Bring on the Huskie s. Those 50 customers are what I call the \u201cminimal customer base\u201d\u2014the minimum nu mber of customers you need to convince of your expertise to fulfill a given dreamline. Second, expert status can be created in le ss than four weeks if you understand basic credibility indicators. It\u2019s important to learn how the PR pros phrase resume points and position their clients. See the boxed te", "xt later in this chapter to learn how. The degree to which you pers onally need expert status also depends on how you obtain your content. There are three main options. 1. Create the content yoursel f, often via paraphrasing and combining points from several books on a topic. 2. Repurpose content that is in the public domain and not subject to copyright protection, such as government documents and material that predates modern copyright law. 3. License content or compensate an expert to help create content. Fees can be one-time and paid up front or royalty-based (5\u201310% of net revenue, for example). If you choose option 1 or 2, you need expe rt status within a limited market. Let\u2019s assume you are a real estate broker and have determined that, like yourself, most brokers want a simple but good we bsite to promote themselves and their businesses. If you read and understand th e three top-selling books on home-page design, you will know more about that topic than 80% of the readership of a magazine for real estate brokers. If you can summari ze the content and make recommendations specific to the needs of the real estate market, a 0.5\u20131.5%", "response from an ad you place in the magazine is not unreasonable to expect. Use the following questions to brainstorm potential how-to or informational products that can be sold to your markets using your expertise or borrowed expertise. Aim for a combination of formats that will lend itself to $50\u2013200 pricing, such as a combination of two CDs (30\u201390 minutes each), a 40-page transcription of the CDs, and a 10-page quickstart guide. Digital delivery is perfectly acceptable\u2014in some cases, ideal\u2014if you can create a high enough perceived value.", "1. How can you tailor a general skill for your market\u2014what I call \u201cniching down\u201d\u2014or add to what is being sold successfully in your target magazines? Think narrow and deep rather than broad. 2. What skills are you interested in that you\u2014and others in your markets\u2014would pay to learn? Become an expert in this skill fo r yourself and then crea te a product to teach the same. If you need help or want to speed up the process, consider the next question. 3. What experts could you interview and record to create a sellable audio CD? These people do not need to be the best, but just be tter than most. Offer them a digital master copy of the interview to do with or sell as they like (this is often enough) and/or offer them a small up-front or ongoing royalty payment. Use Skype.com with HotRecorder (more on these and related tools in Tools a nd Tricks) to record these conversations directly to your PC and send the mp3 f ile to an online transcription service. 4.

The Expert Builder: How to Become a Top Expert in 4 Weeks It\u2019s time to obliterate the cult of the expert. Let the PR world scorn me. First and foremost, there is a difference between being perceived as an expert and being one. In the context of business, the former is what sells product and the latter, relative to your \u201cminimal customer base,\u201d is what cr eates good products and prevents returns. It is possible to know all there is to k now about a subject\u2014medicine, for example\u2014 but if you don\u2019t have M.D. at the end of your name, few will listen. The M.D. is what I term a \u201ccredibility indicator.\u201d The so- called expert with the most credibility indicators, whether acronyms or affiliati ons, is often the most successful in the marketplace, even if other candidates have more in-depth knowledge. This is a matter of superior positioning, not deception. How, then, do we go about acquiring cr edibility indicators i n t h e l e a s t t i m e possible?

Prospects would leave their contact information, and based on the number of callers or response to a follow-up sales letter, the product w ould be abandoned or manufactured.

Let\u2019s use two people, Sherwood and Joha nna, and their two pr oduct ideas\u2014French sailor shirts and a how-to yoga DVD for rock climbers\u2014as case studies of what the testing steps look like an d how you can do the same. Sherwood bought a striped sailing shirt in", "France while traveling last summer, and upon returning to NYC has been continually approached by 20\u201330-year-old males on the street who want to know where to ge t their own. Sensing an opportunity, he requests back issues of NYC-based weekly magazines aimed at this demographic and calls the manufacturer in France for pricing. He learns that he can purchase shirts at a", "wholesale price of $20 that sell for $100 reta il. He adds $5 per shirt to account for shipping to the U.S. and arrives at a per-s hirt cost of $25. It\u2019s n o t q u i t e o u r i d e a l markup (4x vs. 8\u201310x), but he wants to test the product regardless. Johanna is a yoga instructor who has noti ced her growing client base of rock climbers. She is also a rock climber and is considering creati ng a yoga instructional DVD tailored to that sport, which would include a 20-page spiral-bound manual and be priced at $80. She predicts that producti on of a low-budget first edition of the DVD would cost nothing more than a borrowed digital camera and a friend\u2019s iMac for simple editing. She can burn small quantitie s of this first-edition DVD\u2014no menus, just straight footage and titles\u2014on the laptop and create labels with freeware from www.download.com . She has contacted a duplication house and learned that more- professional DVDs will cost $3\u20135 apiece to duplicate in small quantities (minimum of 250), including cases. Now that they have ideas and estima tes of start-up costs, what", "next? Besting the Competition First and foremost, each product must pa ss a competitive litmus test. How can Sherwood and Johanna beat the compe tition and offer a superior product or guarantee? 1. Sherwood and Johanna Google the top term s each would use to try and find their respective products. To come up with rela ted terms and derivative terms, both use search term suggestion tools. Google Adwords Keyword Tool (http://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal ) Enter the potential search terms to find search volume and alternative terms with more search traffic. Click on the \u201cApprox Avg Search Volume\u201d column to so rt results from most to least searched. SEOBook Keyword Tool, SEO for Firefox Extension (http://tools.seobook.com/ ) This is an outstanding resource page with searches powered by Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com ). Both then visit the three websites that consistently appear in top search and PPC positions. How can Sherwood and Johanna differentiate themselves? \uf0b7 Use more credibility indicators? (media, academia, associations, and testimonials) \uf0b7 Create a better guarantee? \uf0b7 Offer better selection? 41 \uf0b7 Free or faster shipping?", "Sherwood notices that the shirts are often ha rd to find on the competitive sites, all of which feature dozens of products, and the shirts are either made in the U.S. (inauthentic) or shipped from France (cus tomers must wait two to four weeks). Johanna cannot find a \u201cyoga for rock climbi ng\u201d DVD, so she is starting from a blank slate. 2. Sherwood and Johanna now need to c r e a t e a o n e - p a g e ( 3 0 0 \u2013 6 0 0 w o r d s ) testimonial-rich advertisement that empha sizes their differentiators and product benefits using text and either persona l photos or stock photos from stock photo websites. Both have spent two weeks collec ting advertisements that have prompted them to make purchases or that have caught their attention in print or online\u2014these will serve as models.42 Johanna asks her clients for te stimonials and Sherwood lets his friends try on the shirts to get severa l for his page. Sherwood also asks the manufacturer for photos a nd advertising samples.

Testing the Advertisement Sherwood and Johanna now need to test a c t u a l c u s t o m e r r e s p o n s e t o t h e i r advertisements. Sherwood first tests his c oncept with a 72-hour eBay auction that includes his advertising text. He sets the \u201creserve\u201d (the lowest price he\u2019ll accept) for one shirt at $50 and cancels the auction last m i n u t e t o a v o i d l e g a l i s s u e s s i n c e h e doesn\u2019t have product to ship. He has received bids up to $75 and decides to move to the next phase of testing. Johanna doesn\u2019t f", "e e l c o m f o r t a b l e w i t h t h e a p p a r e n t deception and skips this preliminary testing. Sherwood\u2019s cost: <$5. Both register domain names for their s oon-to-be one-page sites using the cheap domain registrar www.domainsinseconds.com . Sherwood chooses www.shirtsfromfrance.com a n d J o h a n n a c h o o s e s www.yogaclimber.com . For additional domain names, Johanna uses www.domainsinseconds.com . Cost to both: <$20. Sherwood uses www.weebly.com to create his one-page si te advertisement and then creates two additional pages using the form builder www.wufoo.com . If someone clicks on the \u201cpurchase\u201d butt on at the bottom of the first page, it takes them to a second page with pricin g, shipping and handling,43 and basic contact fields to fill out (including e-mail and phone). If the visitor presses \u201ccon tinue with order,\u201d it takes them to a page that states, \u201cUnfortunate ly, we are currently on back order but will contact you as soon as we have product in stock. Thank you for your patience.\u201d This structure allows him to test the first-page ad", "and his pricing se parately. If someone gets to the last page, it is considered an order.", "Johanna is not comfortable with \u201cdry te sting,\u201d as Sherwood\u2019s approach is known, even though it is legal if the billing data isn\u2019t captured. She instead uses the same two services to create a single webpage with th e content of her one-page ad and an e-mail sign-up for a free \u201ctop 10 tips\u201d list for using yoga for rock climbing. She will consider 60% of the sign-ups as hypothetical orders. Cost to both: <$0. Both set up simple Google Adwords cam paigns with 50\u2013100 search terms to simultaneously test headlines while driving traffic to their pages. Their daily budget limits are set at $50 per day. (At this segue into PPC testing, I recommend you first visit www.adwords/google.com/onlinebusiness and then follow al ong by creating your own account, which should take about 10 minutes . It would be a waste of rain forests to use ten pages to explain terms that can be understood at a glance online.) Sherwood and Johanna decide on the best search terms by usi ng the search term suggestion tools mentioned earlier. Both aim for specific terms when possible (\u201cfrench sailor shirts\u201d vs. \u201cfrench shir ts;\u201d \u201cyoga for sports\u201d vs. \u201c yoga\u201d) for higher", "conversion rates (the percentage of visitors that pur chase) and lower cost-per-click (CPC). They aim also for second through fourth positioning, but no more than $.20 CPC. Sherwood will use Google\u2019s free analytical t o o l s t o t r a c k \u201c o r d e r s \u201d a n d p a g e abandonment rates\u2014what percentage of visi tors leave the site from which pages. Johanna will use www.wufoo.com to track e-mail sign-ups on this small testing scale.44 Cost to both: $0. Both Johanna and Sherwood design Adwords ads that focus on their differentiators. Each Google Adwords ad consists of a head line and then two lines of description, neither of which can exceed 35 characters. In Sherwood\u2019s case, he creates five groups of 10 search terms each. The following are two of his ads. SAILOR SHIRTS FROM FRANCE Johanna creates the same five groups of 10 terms each and tests a number of ads, including these: Notice that these ads can be used to test not just headlines but guarantees, product names, and domain names. It\u2019s as simple as creating several ads, rotated automatically", "by Google, that are identical except for th e one variable to be tested. How do you think I determined the best title for this book? Both Sherwood and Johanna disable the feat ure on Google that serves only the best- performing ad. This is necessary to later compare the click-through rates from each and combine the best elements (headline, domain name, and body text) into a final ad. Last but not least, en sure that the ads don\u2019t trick prospects into visiting the site. The product offer should be clear. Our goal is qua lified traffic, so we do not want to offer something \u201cfree\u201d or otherwise attract window shoppers or the curious who are unlikely to buy. Cost to both: $50 or less per day x 5 days = $250.45 Investing or Divesting Five days later, it\u2019s time to tally the results. What can we consider a \u201cgood\u201d click-th rough and conversion rate? This is where the math can be deceiving. If we\u2019re selling a $10,000 abominable snowman suit with an 80% profit margin, we obviously need a much lower conversion rate than someone who is selling a $50 DVD with a 70% profit ma rgin. For sophisticated", "tools and free spreadsheets that do all sorts of calculations for you, visit the reader-only resources at www.fourhourblog.com . Johanna and Sherwood decide to keep it si mple at this stage: How much did they spend on PPC ads and how much did they \u201csell\u201d? Johanna has done well. The traffic wasn\u2019t e n o u g h t o m a k e t h e t e s t s t a n d u p t o statistical scrutiny, but she spent about $200 on PPC and got 14 sign-ups for a free 10- tip report. If she assumes 60% w ould purchase, that means 8.4 people x $75 profit per DVD = $630 in hypothetical total profit. Th is is also not taking into account the potential lifetime value of each customer. The results of her small test are no guarantee of future success, but the indications are positive enough that she decides to set up a Yahoo Store for $99 per month and a small per-transaction fee. Her credit isn\u2019 t excellent, so she will opt to use www.paypal.com to accept credit cards online instead of approaching her bank for a merchant account.46 She e-mails", "the 10-tip report to those who signed up and asks for their feedback and recommendations for content on the DVD. Ten days later, she has a first attempt at the DVD ready to ship an d her store is online. Her sales to the original sign-ups cover costs of production and she is soon selling a respectable 10 DVDs per week ($750 profit) via Google Adword s. She plans to test advertising in niche magazines and blogs and now needs to c r e a t e a n a u t o m a t i o n a r c h i t e c t u r e t o remove herself from the equation. Sherwood didn\u2019t fare as we ll but still sees potential. He spent $150 on PPC and \u201csold\u201d three shirts for a hypothetical $225 in profit. He had more than enough traffic, but the bulk of visitors left the site on th e pricing page. Rather than drop pricing, he decides to test a \u201c2x money-back guarant ee\u201d on the pricing page, which will enable customers to get a $200 refund if the $100 shir ts aren\u2019t the \u201cmost comfortable they\u2019ve ever owned.\u201d", "He retests and \u201csells\u201d seven shirts for $525 in profit. Based on these results, he sets up a merchant account through his bank and Authorize.net to process credit cards, orders a dozen shirts from Fr ance, and sells them all over the following", "ten days. This gives him enough profit to buy a small display ad at 50% off (asking for a \u201cfirst-time advertiser discount\u201d and then citing a competing magazine to get another 20% off) in a local weekly art magazine, in which he calls the shirt \u201cJackson Pollock Shirts.\u201d He orders two dozen more shirts with net-30 payment terms and puts a toll- free number47 in the print ad that forwards to his cell phone. He does this instead of using a website for two reasons: (1) He wants to determine the most common questions for his FAQ online, and (2) he wants to test an offer of $100 for one shirt ($75 in profit) or \u201cbuy two, get one free\u201d ($200 - $75 = $125 profit). He sells all 24 shirts in th e first five days the magazi ne runs, most through the special offer. Success. He redesigns the pr int ad, putting answers to common questions in the text to cut down on calls for inform ation, and decides to negotiate a longer-term ad agreement with the magazine. He sends hi s sales rep a check for four issues at 30% of their published rates. He calls to", "confirm that they received his check via FedEx and, with check in hand and dead lines looming, they don\u2019t refuse. Sherwood wants to go to Berl in during a two-week break from his job, which he is now considering quitting. How can he ro ll out his success and escape his own company? He needs to build the arch itecture and get his mobile M.B.A. That\u2019s where the next chapter comes in. New Rich Revisited: How Doug Did It R emember Doug from ProSoundEffects.com ? How did he test the idea and go from $0 to $10,000 per month in the pr ocess? He followed these steps. 1. Market Selection He chose music and television producers as his market because he is a musician himself and has used these products. 2. Product Brainstorm He chose the most popular products avai lable for resale from the largest manufacturers of sound libraries and a rranged a wholesale purchase and drop-ship agreement with them. Many of these lib raries cost well above $300 (up to $7,500), and this is precisely why he needs to an swer more customer-service questions than someone with a lower-priced product of $50\u2013200. 3.

On Saturday and Sunday, go to a farmer s\u2019 market or other outdoor event where goods are sold. If this isn\u2019t possible, go to small independent retailers (not chains or mass retail). Set a budget of $100 for your negotiating tuiti on and look for items to purchase that total at least $150. Your job is to get the se llers down to a total of $100 or less for the lot. It is better to practice on many cheap items rather", "than a few big items. Be sure to reply to their first offer with, \u201cWhat type o f d i s c o u n t c a n y o u o f f e r ? \u201d t o l e t t h e m negotiate against themselves. Negotiate near closing time, choose your objective price, bracket, and make a firm offer wi th cash in hand for that amount.48 Practice walking away if your objective price isn\u2019t met. On Monday, call two magazines (expect the first to be awkward) and use the script on the companion site to negotiate, minus the last firm offer. Get them as low as possible and then call them back later to indicate that your proposal was refused by upper management or otherwise vetoed. This is the negotiating equi valent of paper trading.49 Get used to refusing offers and countering in person and\u2014most importantly\u2014on the phone.

Doing this requires minimizing your decision-making responsibilities, whic h achieves our goal of time freedom while setting the stage for doubling and tripling income with no change in hours worked. Call the companies at the end of the chap ter to research costs. Plan and budget accordingly to upgrade infrastructure at the following milestones, which I measure in units of product shipped: Phase I: 0\u201350 Total Units of Product Shipped Do it all yourself. Put your phone number on the site for both general questions and order-taking\u2014this is impor tant in the beginning\u2014and take customer calls to determine common questions that you will an swer later in an online FAQ.", "This FAQ will also be the main material for training phone operators and developing sales scripts.", "Is PPC, an offline advertisement, or your w e b s i t e t o o v a g u e o r m i s l e a d i n g , t h u s attracting unqualified and time-consuming cons umers? If so, change them to answer common questions and make the product benefi ts (including what it isn\u2019t or doesn\u2019t do) clearer. Answer all e-mail and save your responses in one folder called \u201ccustomer service questions.\u201d CC yourself on responses and put the nature of the customers\u2019 questions in the subject lines for future indexing. Persona lly pack and ship a ll product to determine the cheapest options for both. Investigate opening a merchant account from your local small bank (easier to get than with a larg er bank) for later outsourced credit card processing at higher roll-out volumes. Phase II: >10 Units Shipped Per Week Add the extensive FAQ to your website and c ontinue to add answers to common questions as received. Find local fulfillmen t companies in the yellow pages under \u201cfulfillment services\u201d or \u201cmailing servic es.\u201d If you cannot find one there or at www.mfsanet.org , call local printers and ask", "them for recommendations. Narrow the field to those (often the smallest) who w ill agree not to charge you setup fees and monthly minimums. If this isn\u2019t possible, ask for at least 50% off both and then request that the setup fee be applied as an advance against shipping or their other fees. Limit the candidates further to those who can respond to order status e-mail (ideal) or phone calls from customers. The e-mail from your \u201ccustomer service\u201d folder will be provided as copy-and-paste responses, esp ecially those related to order status and refund requests.54 To lower or eliminate miscellaneous fees, explain that you are a start-up and that your budget is small. Tell them you need the cas h for advertising that will drive more shipments. If needed, mention the compe titive companies that you are considering and pit them against one another, using lower pric ing or concessions from one to get larger discounts and bonuses from the others. Before making your final selection, ask for at least three client references and use the following to elicit the negatives: \u201cI understand they\u2019re good, but everyone has weaknesses. If you had to point out where you\u2019ve had some issues", "and what they\u2019re not the best at, what woul d you say? Can you please desc ribe an incident or a disagreement? I expect these with all co mpanies, so it\u2019s no big deal, and it\u2019s confidential, of course.\u201d Ask for \u201cnet-30 terms\u201d\u2014payment for services 30 days after they\u2019re rendered\u2014after one month of prompt payment fo r their services. It is easi er to negotiate all of the above points with smaller operations that need the business. Have your contract manufacturer ship product directly to the fulfillment house once you have decided on one and put the fulfillment house\u2019s e-mail (you can use an e-mail address at your domain and forward it) or phone number on the online \u201cthank you\u201d page for order status questions. Phase III: >20 Units Shipped Per Week", "Now you will have the cash flow to afford the setup fees and the monthly minimums that bigger, more sophisticated outsourcers will ask for. Call the end-to-end fulfillment houses that handle it all\u2014from order status t o r e t u r n s a n d r e f unds. Interview them about costs and ask them for referrals to ca ll centers and credit card processors they\u2019ve collaborated with for file transfers and problem solving. Don\u2019t assemble an architecture of strangers\u2014t here will be programming costs and mistakes, both of which are expensive. Set up an account with the credit card pr ocessor first, for which you will need your own merchant account. This is critical , as the fulfillment house can only handle refunds and declined cards for transacti ons they process themselves through an outsourced credit card processor. Optionally, set up an account with one of the call centers your new fulfillment center recommends. These will often have toll-free numbers you can use instead of purchasing your own. Look at the percentage split of online to phone orders during testing and consider carefully if the extra reve nue from the latter is worth the hassle. It", "often isn\u2019t. Those who call to order will generally order online if given no other option. Before signing on with a call center, get several 800 numbers they answer for current clients and make test calls, as king difficult product-related questions and gauging sales abilities. Call each number at least three times (morning, afternoon, and evening) and note the make-o r-break factor: wait time. The phone should be answered within three to four rings, and if you ar e put on hold, the shorter the wait the better. More than 15 seconds will result in t oo many abandoned calls a nd waste advertising dollars. The Art of Undecision: Fewer Options = More Revenue Companies go out of business when they make the wrong decisions or, just as important, make too many decisi ons. The latter creates complexity. \u2014MIKE MAPLES, cofounder of Motive Comm unications (IPO to $260 million market cap), founding executive of Tivoli (sold to IBM for $750 million), and investor in companies such as Digg.com Joseph Sugarman is the marketing genius behind dozens of direct-response and retail successes, including the BluBlocker sunglasses phenomenon. Prior to his string of home runs on television (he sold 20,000 pa irs", "of BluBlockers w ithin 15 minutes of his first QVC appearance), his domain was print media, where he made millions and built an empire called JS&A Group. He was on ce recruited to design an advertisement for a manufacturer\u2019s watch line. The manufact urer wanted to feature nine different watches in the ad, and Joe recommended featur ing just one. The clie nt insisted and Joe", "offered to do both and test them in the same issue of The Wall Street Journal . The result? The one-watch offer outsold the nine-watch offer 6-to-1.55 Henry Ford once said, referring to his M odel-T, the bestselling car of all time,56 \u201cThe customer can have any color he want s, so long as it\u2019s black.\u201d He understood something that businesspeople seem to have forgotten: Serving the customer (\u201ccustomer service\u201d) is not becoming a pers onal concierge and catering to their every whim and want. Customer service is prov iding an excellent product at an acceptable price and solving legitimate problems (lost packages, replacements, refunds, etc.) in the fastest manner possible. That\u2019s it. The more options you offer the customer, the more indecision you create and the fewer orders you receive\u2014it is a disservice all around. Furthermore, the more options you offer the customer, the more manufact uring and customer service burden you create for yourself. The art of \u201cundecision\u201d refers to mi nimizing the number of decisions your customers can or need to make. Here are a few methods that I and other NR have used to reduce service overhead 20\u201380%: 1. Offer one or two purchase options (\u201cba", "sic\u201d and \u201cpremium,\u201d for example) and no more. 2. Do not offer multiple shipping options. Offer one fast method instead and charge a premium. 3. Do not offer overnight or expedited shipping (it is possible to refer them to a reseller who does, as is true with all of these points) , as these shipping methods will produce hundreds of anxious phone calls. 4. Eliminate phone orders completely a nd direct all prospects to online ordering. This seems outrageous until you realize that success stories like Amazon.com have depended on it as a fundame ntal cost-saver to survive and thrive. 5. Do not offer international shipments. Spending 10 minutes per order filling out customs forms and then dealing with customer complaints when the product costs 20\u2013100% more with tariffs and duties is about as fun as headbutting a curb. It\u2019s a bout as profitable, too. Some of these policies hint at what is p e r h a p s t h e b i g g e s t t i m e - s a v e r o f a l l : customer filtering. Not All Customers Are Created Equal", "O nce you reach Phase III and have some cash flow, it\u2019s time to re-evaluate your customers and thin the herd. There are good and bad versions of all things: good food, bad food; good movies, bad movies; good sex, bad sex; and, yes, good customers and bad customers. Decide now to do business with the form er and avoid the latter. I recommend looking at the customer as an equal trading pa rtner and not as an in fallible blessing of a human being to be pleased at all costs. I f y o u o f f e r a n e x c e l lent product at an acceptable price, it is an equal trade and not a begging session between subordinate (you) and superior (customer). Be prof essional but never kowtow to unreasonable people. Instead of dealing with problem custom ers, I recommend you prevent them from ordering in the first place. I know dozens of NR who don\u2019t accept Western Union or checks as payment. Some would respond to this with, \u201cYou\u2019re giving up 10\u201315% of your sales!\u201d The NR, in turn, would say, \u201cI am, but I\u2019m also avoidi ng the 10\u201315% of", "the cu stomers who create 40% of the expenses and eat 40% of my time.\u201d It\u2019s classic 80/20. Those who spend the least and ask for the most before ordering will do the same after the sale. Cutting them out is both a good lifestyle decision and a good financial decision. Low-profit and high-maintenance cu stomers like to call operators and spend up to 30 minutes on the phone asking questions t h a t a r e u n i m p o r t a n t o r a n s w e r e d online, costing\u2014in my case\u2014$24.90 (30 x $0.83) per 30-minute incident, eliminating the minuscule profit they contribute in the first place. Those who spend the most complain the least. In addition to our premium $50\u2013200 pricing, here are a few additional policie s that attract the high-profit and low- maintenance customers we want: 1. Do not accept payment via Western Union, checks, or money order. 2. Raise wholesale minimums to 12\u2013100 units and require a tax ID number to qualify resellers who are real busine sspeople and not time-intensive novices. Don\u2019t run a persona l business school. 3. Refer all potential resellers", "to an online order form that must be printed, filled out, and faxed in. Never negotiate pricing or approve lower pricing for higher-volume orders. Cite \u201ccompany policy\u201d due to having had problems in the past. 4. Offer low-priced products (\u00e0 la MR I\u2019s NO2 book) instead of free products to capture contact information for follo w-up sales. Offering something for free is the best way to attract time-eaters and spend money on those unwilling to return the favor. 5. Offer a lose-win guarantee (see boxed text) inst ead of free trials.", "6. Do not accept orders from common mail fraud countries such as Nigeria. Make your customer base an exclusiv e club, and treat the members well once they\u2019ve been accepted. The Lose-Win Guarantee\u2014How to Sell Anything to Anyone If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster. \u2014CLINT EASTWOOD The 30-day money-back guarantee is dead. It just doesn\u2019t have the pizzazz it once did. If a product doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ve been lied to and will have to spend an afternoon at the post office to return it. This costs me more than just the price I paid for the product, both in time and actual postage. Risk elimination just isn\u2019t enough. This is where we enter the neglected realm of lose-win guarantees and risk reversal. The NR use what most consider an aftert hought\u2014the guarantee\u2014as a cornerstone sales tool. The NR aim to make it profitable for the cu stomer even if the product fails. Lose- win guarantees not only remove risk for the consumer but put the company at financial risk. Here are a few examples of putti ng your money where your mouth is. Delivered in 30 minutes or less or it\u2019s free! (Domino\u2019s Pizza built its busin ess", "on this guarantee.) We\u2019re so confident you\u2019ll like CIALIS, if you don\u2019t we\u2019ll pay for the brand of your choice . (The \u201cCIALIS\u00ae Promise Program\u201d offers a free sample of CIALIS and then offers to pay for competing products if CIALIS doesn\u2019t live up to the hype.) If your car is stolen, we\u2019ll p ay $500 of your insurance deductible . (This guarantee helped THE CLUB become the #1-selling mechanical automobile anti-theft device in the world.) 110% guaranteed to wo rk within 60 minutes of the first dose . (This was for BodyQUICK and a first among sports nutrition products. I offered to not only refund customers th e price of the product if it didn\u2019t work within 60 minutes of the first dose , but also to send them a check for 10% more.) The lose-win guarantee might seem like a big risk, especially when someone can abuse it for profit like in the Body QUICK example, but it isn\u2019t \u2026 if y o u r p r o d u c t delivers. Most people are honest.", "Let\u2019s look at some actual numbers. Returns for BodyQUICK, even with a 60-da y return period (and partially because of it57), are less than 3% in an industry in which the average is 12\u201315% for a normal 30-day 100% money-back guarantee. Sales in creased more than 300% within four weeks of introducing the 110% guarant ee, and returns decreased overall. Johanna adopted this lose-win offer an d came up with \u201cIncrease sport-specific flexibility 40% in two weeks or return it for a full refund (including shipping) and keep the 20-minute bonus DVD as our gift.\u201d Sherwood found his guarantee as well: \u201cIf thes e shirts are not the most comfortable you\u2019ve ever worn, return them and get 2-ti mes your purchase price back. Each shirt is also guaranteed for life\u2014if it gets threadbare , send it back and we\u2019l l replace it free of charge.\u201d Both of them increased sales more than 200% in the first two months. Return percentage remained the same for Johanna and increased 50% for Sherwood, from 2 to 3%. Disaster? Far from it. Instead of se lling 50 and getting one back with a 100% guarantee [(50 x $100) \u2013 $100 = $4,900 in revenue],", "he sold 200 and got six back with the 200% guarantee [(200 x $100) \u2013 (6 x $200) = $18,800 in revenue]. I\u2019ll take the latter. Lose-win is the new win-win. St and out and reap the rewards. Little Blue Chip: How to L ook Fortune 500 in 45 Minutes Are you tired of sand being kicked in your face? I promise you new muscles in days! \u2014CHARLES ATLAS, strongman who sold more than $30 million worth of \u201cdynamic-tension\u201d muscle courses through comic books If approaching large resellers or potential partners, small company size will be an obstacle. This discrimination is often as insurmountable as it is unfounded. Fortunately, a few simple steps can dram atically upgrade your budding Fortune 500 image and take your muse from coffee shop to boardroom in 45 minutes or less. 1. Don\u2019t be the CEO or founder . Being the \u201cCEO\u201d or \u201cFounder\u201d screams star t-up. Give yourself the mid-level title of \u201cvice president\u201d (VP), \u201cdirector,\u201d or something similar that can be added to depending on the occasion (Director of Sale s, Director of Business Development, etc.). For negotiation purposes as well, remember that it is best not to appear to be the ultimate", "decision-maker. 2. Put multiple e-mail and phone contacts on the website . Put various e-mail addresses on the \u201ccontact u s \u201d p a g e f o r d i f f e r e n t d e p a r t m e n t s , such as \u201chuman resources,\u201d \u201csales,\u201d \u201cgen eral inquiries,\u201d \u201cwhol esale distribution,\u201d \u201cmedia/PR,\u201d \u201cinvestors,\u201d \u201cweb comments, \u201d \u201corder status,\u201d and so on. In the", "beginning, these will all forward to your e- mail address. In Phase III, most will forward to the appropriate outsourcers. Mult iple toll-free numbers can be used in the same fashion. 3. Set up an Interactive Voice Re sponse (IVR) remote receptionist . It is possible to sound like a blue chip for less than $30. In fe wer than ten minutes on a site such as www.angel.com , which boasts clients such as Reebok and Kellog\u2019s, it is possible to set up an 800 nu mber that greets callers with a voice prompt such as, \u201cThank you for calling [business name]. Please say the name of the person or department you would like to reach or just hold on for a list of options.\u201d Upon speaking your name or selecting the appropriate department, the caller is forwarded to your preferred phone or the appropriate outsourcer\u2014with on-hold music and all. 4. Do not provide home addresses . Do not use your home address or you will ge t visitors. Prior to securing an end-to- end fulfillment house that can handle check s and money orders\u2014if you decide to accept them\u2014use a post office box but leave out the \u201cPO Box\u201d", "and include the street address of the post office itself. Thus \u201cPO Box 555, Nowhere, US 11936\u201d becomes \u201cSuite 555, 1234 Downtown Ave., US 11936.\u201d Go forth and project professionali sm with a well-designed image. Perceived size does matter. COMFORT CHALLENGE Relax in Public (2 days) This is the last Comfort Challenge, placed prior to the chapter that tackles the most uncomfortable turning point for most o ffice dwellers: negotiating remote work agreements. This challenge is intended to be fun while showing\u2014in no uncertain terms\u2014that the rules most follow are nothing more than social conventions. There are no legal boundaries stopping you from creating an ideal life \u2026 or just being self- entertained and causing mass confusion. So, relaxing in public. Sounds easy, right ? I\u2019m somewhat famous for relaxing in style to get a laugh out of fr iends. Here is the deal, and I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re male or female, 20 or 60, Mongolian or Martia n. I call the following a \u201ctime-out.\u201d Once per day for two days, simply lie down in the middle of a cr owded public place at some point. Lunchtime is ideal. It can be a well-trafficked sidewalk, the middle of a", "popular Starbucks, or a popular bar. There is no real technique involved. Just lie down and remain silent on the ground for about ten seconds, and then get up and continue on with whatever you were doing before. I used to do this at nightclubs to clear space for break-dancing circles. No one responded to pleading, but going catatonic on the ground did the trick.", "Don\u2019t explain it at all. If someone asks about it after the fact (he or she will be too confused to ask you while you\u2019re doing it for 10 seconds), just respond, \u201cI just felt like lying down for a second.\u201d The less you say, th e funnier and more gratifying this will be. Do it on solo missions for the first two days , and then feel free to do it when with a group of friends. It\u2019s a riot. It isn\u2019t enough to think out side the box. Thinking is passive. Get used to acting outside the box.

Then politely asking them to put a blurb in the \u201cRecent News\u201d section of the group. This makes it more trustworthy than a wall post, and it st ays up there (free advertising) un til the admin removes it. One hundred times better than a wall post. In one case, the admin purchased my muse, posted my note for me on the groups\u2019 \u201cRecent News\u201d section, then e-mailed the entire group telling them they have to check out my site. \u2014GAVIN 50.

Remember Sherwood? His French shirts are beginni ng to move and he is itchi ng to ditch the U.S. for a global walkabout. He has more than enough ca sh now but needs to escape constant supervision in the office before he can implement all the timesaving tools from Elimination and travel. He is a mechanical engineer and is produc ing twice as many designs in half the time since erasing 90% of his time-wasters a nd interruptions. This quantum leap in performance has been noticed by his supervisors and his value to the company has increased, making it more expensive to lose him. More value means more leverage for negotiations. Sherwood has been sure to hold back some of his productivity and efficiency so that he can highlight a sudde n jump in both during a remote work trial period. Since eliminating most of his meetings a nd in-person discussions, he has naturally moved about 80% of all comm unication with his boss and co lleagues to e-mail and the remaining", "20% to phone. Not only th is, but he has used tips from chapter 7 , \u201cInterrupting Interruption and the Art of Refu sal,\u201d to cut unimportant and repetitive e- mail volume in half. This will make the move to remote less noticeable, if at all noticeable, from a managerial standpoint. Sherwood is running at full speed with less and less supervision. Sherwood implements his escape in five s t e p s , b e g i n n i n g o n J u l y 1 2 d u r i n g t h e slow business season and lasting two months , ending with a trip to Oktoberfest in", "Munich, Germany, for two weeks as a final test before bigger and bolder vagabonding plans. Step 1: Increase Investment First, he speaks with his boss on July 12 a b o u t a d d i t i o n a l t r a i n i n g t h a t m i g h t b e available to employees. He proposes ha ving the company pay for a four-week industrial design class to help him better interface with clients, being sure to mention the benefit to the boss and business (i.e., he \u2019ll decrease intradepartmental back-and- forth and increase both client results and billable time) . Sherwood wants the company to invest as much as possible in him so that the loss is greater if he quits. Step 2: Prove Increased Output Offsite Second, he calls in sick the next Tuesday and Wednesday, July 18 and 19 , to showcase his remote working productivity.60 H e d e c i d e s t o c a l l i n s i c k b e t w e e n Tuesday and Thursday for two reasons: It l ooks less like a", "lie fo r a three-day weekend and it also enables him to se e how well he functions in social isolatio n without the imminent reprieve of the weekend. He ensu res that he doubles his work output on both days, leaves an e-mail trail of some sort for his boss to notice, and keeps quantifiable records of what he accomplished for refere nce during later negotiations. Since he uses expensive CAD software that is only license d on his office desktop, Sherwood installs a free trial of GoToMyPC remote access soft ware so that he can pilot his office computer from home. Step 3: Prepare the Quantifiable Business Benefit Third, Sherwood creates a bulle t-point list of how much more he achieved outside the office with explanations. He realizes that he needs to present remote working as a good business decision and not a personal per k. The quantifiable e nd result was three more designs per day than his usual average and three total hours of additional billable client time. For explanations, he identifies removal of commute and fewer distractions from office noise. Step 4: Propose a Revocable Trial Period Fourth, fresh off completing the comfort chal lenges", "from previous chapters, Sherwood confidently proposes an innocent one-day-pe r-week remote work trial period for two weeks. He plans a script in advance but doe s not make it a PowerPoint presentation or otherwise give it the appearance of something serious or irreversible.61 Sherwood knocks on his boss\u2019s office door around 3 P.M. on a relatively relaxed Thursday, July 27 , the week after his ab sence, and his script looks like the following. Stock phrases are underlined and f ootnotes explain negotiating points. Sherwood: Hi, Bill. Do you have a quick second? Bill: Sure. What\u2019s up?", "Sherwood: I just wanted to bounce an idea off of you that\u2019s been on my mind. Two minutes should be plenty. Bill: OK. Shoot. Sherwood: Last week, as you know, I was sick. Long story short, I decided to work at home despite feeling terrible. So here\u2019s the funny part. I thought I would get nothing done, but ended up finishing three more designs than usual on both days. Plus, I put in three more billable hours th an usual without the commute, office noise, distractions, etc. OK, so here\u2019s where I\u2019m going. Just as a trial, I\u2019d like to propose working from home Mondays and Tuesdays for just two w eeks. You can veto it whenever you want, and I\u2019ll come in if we need to do meetings, but I\u2019d like to try it for just two weeks and review the results. I\u2019m 100% confident that I\u2019ll get twice as much done. Does that seem reasonable? Bill: Hmm \u2026 What if we need to share client designs? Sherwood: T h e r e \u2019 s a p r o g r a m c a l l e d G o T o M y P C t h", "a t I u s e d t o a c c e s s t h e o f f i c e computer when I was sick. I can view ev erything remotely, and I\u2019ll have my cell phone on me 24/7. Sooooo \u2026 What do you think? Test it out st arting next Monday and see how much more I get done?62 Bill: Ummm \u2026 OK, fine. But it\u2019s just a test. I have a meeting in five and have to run, but let\u2019s talk soon. Sherwood: Great. Thanks for the time. I\u2019ll ke ep you posted on it all. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised. Sherwood didn\u2019t expect to get two days pe r week approved. He asked for two so that, in the case his boss refused, he could as k for just one as a fallback position (bracketing). Why didn\u2019t Sherwood go for fi ve days remote per week? Two reasons. First, it\u2019s a lot for management to accept off the bat. We need to ask for an inch and turn it into a foot without setting off panic alarms. Sec ond, it is a good idea to hone your remote-working abilities\u2014re hearse a", "bit\u2014before shooting for the big time, as it decreases the likelihood of crises and screwups that will get remote rights revoked. Step 5: Expand Remote Time Sherwood ensures that his days outside of the office are his most productive to date, even minimally dropping in-office production to heighten the contrast. He sets a meeting to discuss the results with his boss on August 15 and prepares a bullet-point page detailing increased results and items completed compared to in-office time. He suggests upping the ante to four days per week remote for a two-week trial, fully prepared to concede to three days if need be. Sherwood: It really turn ed out even better th an I expected. If you look at the numbers, it makes a lot of business sense, and I\u2019m en joying work a lot more now. So, here we are. I\u2019d like to suggest, if you think it makes sense, that I try four days a week for another two-week trial. I was thinking that coming in Friday63would make sense to prepare for the coming week, but we could do whichever day you prefer.", "Bill: Sherwood, I\u2019m really not sure we can do that. Sherwood: What\u2019s your main concern?64 Bill: I t s e e m s l i k e y o u \u2019 r e o n y o u r w a y o u t . I mean, are you going to quit on us? Second, what if everyone wants to do the same? Sherwood: F a i r e n o u g h . G o o d p o i n t s .65 F i r s t , t o b e h o n e s t , I w a s c l o s e t o q u i t t i n g before, with all the interruptions and comm ute and whatnot, but I\u2019m actually feeling great now with the change in routine.66 I\u2019m doing more and feel relaxed for a change. Second, no one should be allowed to work re motely unless they can show increased productivity, and I\u2019m the perfect experiment. If they can show it, however, why not let them do it on a trial basis? It lowers costs for the office, increases productivity, and makes", "employees happier. So, what do you say? Can I test it out for two weeks and come in Fridays to take care of the offi ce stuff? I\u2019ll still document everything, and you, of course, have the right to change your mind at any point. Bill: Man, you are an insi stent one. OK, we\u2019ll give it a shot, but don\u2019t go blabbing about it. Sherwood: Of course. Thanks, Bill. I apprec iate the trust. Talk to you soon. Sherwood continues to be productive at h o m e a n d m a i n t a i n s h i s l o w e r i n - o f f i c e performance. He reviews the results with his boss after two weeks and continues with four remote days per week for an additional two weeks until Tuesday, September 19 , when he requests a full-time remote trial of two weeks while he is visiting relatives out of state.67 Sherwood\u2019s team is in the middle of a project that requires his expertise, and he is prepared to q u i t i f h i s b o s s r e f u", "s e s . H e r e a lizes that, just as you want to negotiate ad pricing close to deadlines, getting what you want often depends more on when you ask for it than how you ask for it. Though he woul d prefer not to quit, his income from shirts is more than enough to fund his dream -lines of Oktoberfest and beyond. His boss acquiesces and Sherwood doesn\u2019t ha ve to use his threat of quitting. He goes home that evening and buys a $524 round-tr ip ticket, less than one week\u2019s shirt sales, to Munich for Oktoberfest. Now he can implement all the time-savers possible and hack out the inessentials. Somewhere between drinking wheat beer a nd dancing in lederhosen, Sherwood will get his work done in fine form, leaving his company better off than prior to 80/20 and leaving himself all the time in the world. But hold on a second \u2026 What if your boss still refuses? Hmm \u2026 Then they force your hand. If upper management won\u2019t see the light, you\u2019ll just have to use the next chapter to fire their asses. An Alternative: The Hourglass Approach", "It can be effective to take a longer period of absence up front in what some NR have termed the \u201chourglass\u201d approach, so na med because you use a long proof-of-concept up front to get a short remote agreement and then negotiate back up to full-time out of the office. Here\u2019s what it looks like. 1. Use a preplanned project or emergency (family issue, personal issue, relocation, home repairs, whatever) that requires you to take one or two weeks out of the office. 2. Say that you recognize you can\u2019t just s t o p w o r k i n g a n d t h a t y o u w o u l d prefer to work instead of taking vacation days. 3. Propose how you can work remotely and offer, if necessary, to take a pay cut for that period (and that period only) if perfor mance isn\u2019t up to par upon returning. 4. Allow the boss to collaborate on how to do it so that he or she is invested in the process. 5. Make the two weeks \u201coff\u201d the most productive period you\u2019 ve ever had at work. 6. Show your boss the quantifiable", "results upon returning, and tell him or her that\u2014without all the distractions, co mmute, etc.\u2014you can get twice as much done. Suggest two or three days at home per week as a trial for two weeks. 7. Make those remote days ultraproductive. 8. Suggest only one or two days in the office per week. 9. Make those days the leas t productive of the week. 10. Suggest complete mobility\u2014the boss will go for it. Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS Recently, I was asked if I was going to fire an employee who made a mistake that cost the company $600,000. No, I re plied, I just spen t $600,000 training him. \u2014THOMAS J. WATSON , founder of IBM Liberty means responsibility.

Resolve to grab the reins\u2014 the rest of your life depends on it. The following questions and actions will help you to replace presence-based work with performance-based freedom. 1. If you had a heart attack, and assu ming your boss were sympathetic, how could you work remo tely for four weeks? If you hit a brick wall with a task that doesn\u2019t seem remote-compatible or if you predict resistance from your boss, ask the following: o What are you accomplishing with this task\u2014 what is the purpose? o If you had to f i n d o t h e r w a y s t o a c c o m p l i s h the same\u2014if your life depended on it\u2014how would you do it? Remote conferencing? Video conferencing? GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, DimDim.com (Mac), or related services? o Why would your boss resist remote work? What is the immediate negative effect it would have on", "the company and what could you do to prevent or minimize it? 2. Put yourself in your boss\u2019s shoes. Ba sed on your work history, would you trust yourself to work outside of the office? If you wouldn\u2019t, reread Elimination to improve production and consider the hourglass option. 3. Practice environment-free productivity . Attempt to work for two to three hours in a caf\u00e9 for two Saturdays prior to proposing a remote trial. If you exercise in a gym, attempt to exercise for those two weeks at home or othe rwise outside of the gym environment. The purpose here is to separate your activities from a single envi ronment and ensure that you have the discipline to work solo. 4. Quantify current productivity .", "If you have applied the 80/20 Principle, set the rules of interrupting interruption, and completed related groundwork, your performance should be at an all-time high in quantifiable terms, whether customers served, revenue generated, pages produced, speed of accounts receivable, or otherwise. Document this. 5. Create an opportunity to demonstrate remote work productivity before asking for it as a policy . This is to test your ability to work out side of an office environment and rack up some proof that you can kick a ss without constant supervision. 6. Practice the art of getting past \u201cno\u201d before proposing . Go to farmers\u2019 markets to negotiate pr ices, ask for free first-class upgrades, ask for compensation if you encounter poor service in restaurants, and otherwise ask for the world and practic e using the following magic questions when people refuse to give it to you. \u201cWhat would I need to do to [desired outcome]?\u201d \u201cUnder what circumstances w ould you [desired outcome]?\u201d \u201cHave you ever made an exception?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve made an exception before, haven\u2019t you?\u201d (If no for either of the last two, ask, \u201cWhy not?\u201d If yes, ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d) 7. Put your employer on remote training wheels\u2014propose Monday", "or Friday at home . Consider doing this, or the following st ep, during a period when it would be too disruptive to fire you, even if you were marginally less productive while remote. If your employer refuses, it\u2019s time to get a new boss or become an entrepreneur. The job will never give you the requisite tim e freedom . If you decide to jump ship, cons ider letting them make you walk the plank\u2014quitting is often less appealing than tactfully g e t t i n g f i r e d a n d u s i n g s e v e r a n c e o r unemployment to ta ke a long vacation. 8. Extend each successful trial period until you reach full-time or your desired level of mobility . Don\u2019t underestimate how much your company needs you. Perform well and ask for what you want. If you don\u2019t get it ove r time, leave. It\u2019s too big a world to spend most of life in a cubicle.", "LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION Consider trying Earth Class Mail, a service that you can reroute all your mail to, at which point they scan and e-mail you everyt hing that comes in, giving you the option of recycling/shredding junk, getting a scan of the contents, or having specific items forwarded to you or someone you designate.

Just because you are embarrassed to admit that you\u2019re still livi ng the consequences of bad decisions made 5, 10, or 20 year s ago shouldn\u2019t stop you from making good decisions now.

Quitting is permanent .", "Far from it. Use the Q&A questions in this chapter and chapter 3 ( F e a r - s e t t i n g ) t o examine how you could pick up your chosen car eer track or start another company at a later point. I have never seen an example wh ere a change of direction wasn\u2019t somehow reversible. 2. I won\u2019t be able to pay the bills . Sure you will. First of all, the objective will be to have a new job or source of cash flow before quitting your cu rrent job. Problem solved. If you jump ship or get fired, it isn\u2019t hard to eliminate most expenses temporarily and live on savings for a brief period. From renting out your home to refinancing or selling it, there are options . There are always options. It might be emotionally difficult, but you w on\u2019t starve. Park your car in the garage and cancel insurance for a few months. Carpool or take the bus unt il you find the next gig. Rack up some more credit card debt and cook instead of eat ing out. Sell all the crap that you spent hundreds or", "thousands on and never use. Take a full inventory of your assets, cash reserves, de bts, and monthly expenses. How long could you survive with your curren t resources or if you sold some assets?

If you\u2019ve made it this far in life, losing or dropping a job will often be litt le more than a few weeks of vacation (unless you want more) prior to something better. 3. Health insurance and retirement accounts disappear if I quit . Untrue. I was scared of both when I was eliminated from TrueSAN. I had visions of rotting teeth and working at Wal-Mart to survive. Upon looking at the facts and exploring op tions, I realized th at I could have identical medical and dental coverage \u2014the same provider and network\u2014for $300\u2013 500 per month.

It is not at all difficult to sweep gaps under the rug and make uncommon items the very things that get job interviews. How? Do something interesting and make them jealous. If you quit and then sit on y our ass, I wouldn\u2019t hire you either.", "On the other hand, if you have a one-to -two-year world circumnavigation on your resume or training with professional socce r teams in Europe to your credit, two interesting things happen upon returning to the working world.

I was on a no-carbohydrate diet, and I had used this recipe before. It had been so delicious that my roommates wanted their fa ir share and insisted on an attempt at bulk production. Hence began the mathema tical shenanigans and problems. Before Splenda\u00ae and other miracles of s ugar imitation came on the scene, the hard core used stevia, an herb 300 times sweeter than sugar. One drop was like 300 packets of sugar. It was a delicate tool and I wasn\u2019t a delicate cook. I had once made a small handful of cookies using baking soda inst ead of baking powder, and that was bad enough to drive my roommates to puke on th e lawn. This new masterpiece made the cookies look like fine dining:", "It tasted lik e liquid cream cheese mixed with cold water and about 600 packets of sugar.", "I then did what any normal and rational pe rson would do: I grabbed the largest soup ladle with a sigh and sat down in front of the TV to face my punishment. I had wasted an entire Sunday and a boatload of ingredie nts\u2014it was time to reap what I had sown. One hour and 20 large spoonfuls later, I hadn\u2019 t made a dent in the enormous batch of soup, but I was down for the count. Not onl y could I not eat a nything but soup for two days, I couldn\u2019t bring myse lf to even look at cheesecake, previously my favorite dessert, for more than four years. Stupid? Of course. It\u2019s about as stupid as one can get. This is a ridiculous and micro example of what people do on a larger scal e with jobs all the time: self-imposed suffering that can be avoided. Sure, I learne d a lesson and paid for the mistake. The real question is\u2014for what? There are two types of mistakes: mistak es of ambition and mistakes of sloth. The first is the result of a decision to act\u2014to do somethi ng. This type of mistake is made with", "incomplete information, as it\u2019s impossible to have all the facts beforehand. This is to be encouraged. Fortune favors the bold. The second is the result of a decision of sloth\u2014to not do something\u2014wherein we refuse to change a bad situa tion out of fear despite having all the facts. This is how learning experiences become terminal puni shments, bad relati onships become bad marriages, and poor job choices be come lifelong prison sentences. \u201cYeah, but what if I\u2019m in an industry where jumping around is looked down upon?

I\u2019ve seen one determinant of sex appeal to good employers: performance. If you are a rock star when it comes to results, it doesn\u2019t matter if you jump ship from a bad company after three weeks. On the ot her hand, if tolerating a puni shing work environment for years at a time is a prerequisite for promoti on in your field, could it be that you\u2019re in a game not worth winning?

I have a full and busy life, se\u00f1or.\u201d The American laughed and stood tall. \u201cSir, I\u2019m a Harvard M.B.A. and can help you.

I ne eded a recharge and four weeks seemed \u201creasonable\u201d by whatever made-up benchmark you can use for such a thing. A friend familiar with Central America du tifully pointed out that it would never work, as Costa Rica was about to enter its rainy season. Torre ntial downpours weren\u2019t the uplifting jolt I needed, so I shifted my focus to four week s in Spain. It\u2019s a long trip over the Atlantic, though, and Spain was close to other countries I\u2019d always wanted to visit. I lost \u201creasonable\u201d somewhere shortly thereafter and decided that I deserved a full three months to explore my roots in Scandinavia after four weeks in Spain.

It\u2019s like taki ng a starving dog to an all-you-can-eat buffet. It will eat itself to death. I did this three months into my 15-month vision quest, visiting seven countries and going through at least 20 ch eck-ins and checkouts with a friend who had negotiated three weeks off.

I recommend doing the exact opposite. The alternative to binge travel\u2014the mini -retirement\u2014entails relocating to one place for one to six months before going home or moving to another locale. It is the anti- vacation in the most positive sense. Though it can be relaxing, the mini-retirement is not an escape from your life but a reexamina tion of it\u2014the creation of a blank slate. Following elimination and automation, what would you be escaping from? Rather than seeking to see the world through photo ops between foreign-but-familiar hotels, we aim to experience it at a speed that lets it change us. This is also different from a sabbatical . Sabbaticals are often viewed much like retirement: as a one-time event. Savor it now while you can. The mini-retirement is defined as recurring\u2014it is a lifestyle .

True freedom is much more than having enough income and time to do what you want. It is quite possible\u2014actually the rule rather than the exception\u2014to have financial and time freedom but still be caught in the throes of the rat race. One cannot be free from the stresses of a speed- and size-obsessed culture until you are free from the materialistic addictions, time-famine mind-set, and comparative impulses that created it in the first place. This takes time. The effect is not cumu lative, and no number of two-week (also called \u201ctoo weak\u201d)70 sightseeing trips can replace one good walkabout.71 In the experience of those I\u2019ve interviewe d, it takes two to three months just to unplug from obsolete routines and become aware of just how much we distract ourselves with constant motion.

But I\u2019m a woman\u2014traveling al one would be dangerous.", "M ost excuses not to travel are exactly that\u2014e xcuses. I\u2019ve been there, so this isn\u2019t a holier-than-thou sermon. I know too well that it\u2019s eas ier to live with ourselves if we cite an external reason for inaction. I\u2019ve since met paraplegics and the deaf, senior citizens and single mothers, home owners and the poor, all of whom have sought and found excel lent life-changing reasons for extended travel instead of dwelling on the million small reasons against it . Most of the concerns above are addressed in the Q&A, but one in particular requires a bit of preemptive nerve calming. It\u2019s 10:00 P.M. Do You Know Where Your Children Are? The prime fear of all parents prior to their first international trip is somehow losing a child in the shuffle. The good news is that if you are comforta ble taking your kids to New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C ., or London, you will have even less to worry about in the starting cities I recommend in the Q&A. There are fewer guns and violent crimes in all of them compared to most large U.S. cities. The likelihood of problems is decreased further when travel is less", "ai rport and hotel-hopping among strangers and more relocation to a second home: a mini-retirement. But still, what if? Jen Errico, a single mother who took her two children on a five-month world tour, had a more acute fear than most, one that often woke her at 2:00 A.M. in a cold sweat: What if something happens to me? She wanted to prime her kids for worst-case scenario but didn\u2019t want to scare them to death, so\u2014like all good mothers\u2014she made it a game: Who can best memorize the itineraries, hotel addresses, and Mom\u2019s phone number? She had emergency contacts in each country whose numbers were loaded in to the speed dial of her cell phone, which had global roaming. In the end, nothing happe ned. Now she\u2019s planning to move to a ski chalet in Europe and send her kids to school in multilingual France. Success begets success. She was most afraid in Singapore, and in retrospect, it was where she had the least reason to be worried (she took her kids to South Africa, among other places). She was scared because it was the first stop and she was unaccustomed to traveling with her kids. It was per", "ception, not reality. Robin Malinsky-Rummell, who spent a year traveling through South America with her husband and seven-year-old son, was wa rned by friends and family not to visit Argentina after their devaluation riots in 2001. She did her homework, decided that the fear was unfounded, and proceeded to have the time of her life in Patagonia. When she told locals that she was originally from New York, their eyes widened and jaws dropped: \u201cI saw those buildi ngs blow up on TV! I would ne ver go to such a dangerous place!\u201d Don\u2019t assume that places abroad are more dangerous than your hometown. Most aren\u2019t.", "Robin is convinced, as are other NR parents, that people use children as an excuse to stay in their comfort zones. It\u2019s an easy excuse not to do something adventurous. How to overcome the fear? Robin recommends two things: 1. Before embarking on a long internati onal trip with your children for the first time, take a trial run for a few weeks. 2. For each stop, arrange a week of lan guage classes that begin upon arrival and take advantage of transportation fr om the airport if available. The school staff will often handle apartment rentals for you, and you will be able to make friends and learn the area befo re setting off on your own. But what if your concern isn\u2019t so much losing your children but losing your mind because of your children? Several families interviewe d for this book recommended the oldest persuasive tool known to man: bribery. Each child is give n some amount of virtual cash, 25\u201350 cents, for each hour of good behavior. The same amoun t is subtracted from their accounts for breaking the rules. All purchases for fun\u2014whether souvenirs, ice cream, or otherwise\u2014come out of their own individua l accounts.", "No bala nce, no goodies. This often requires more self-control on the pa rt of the parents than the children. How to Get Airfare at 50\u201380% Off This is not a book on budget travel. Most of the cost-cutting recommendations found in such guides are designed with the binge traveler in mind. For someone embarking on a mini-retirement, an extra $150 for hassle-free ai rfare amortized over two months is a better deal than 20 hours of manipulati ng frequent-flier points on an unknown airline or chasing questionable deals. Following two weeks of research, I once bought a one-way standby ticket to Europe for $120. I arrived at JFK brimming with enthusiasm and confidence\u2014look at all these schmucks paying retail!\u2014and 90% of the \u201cparticipating\u201d airlines refused my ticket. Those that didn\u2019t were booked for w eeks solid. I ended up staying in a hotel for two nights for a $300 tab, filing a complain t with AMEX, and eventually calling 1\u2013 800-FLY-EUROPE from the JFK terminal in frustration. I bought a round-trip ticket to London on Virgin Atlantic for $300 and le ft an hour later. The same ticket cost more than $700 a week earlier. After 25 countries, I\u2019ve", "found a few simple s t r a t e g i e s t h a t g e t y o u 9 0 % o f t h e possible savings without wasting time or producing migraines. 1. Use credit cards with reward points for large muse-related advertising and manufacturing expenses.", "I am not spending more money to get pennies on the dollar\u2014these costs are inevitable, so I capitalize on them. This alone gets me a free round-trip international ticket each three months. 2. Purchase tickets far in advance (three months or more) or last minute, and aim for both departure and return between Tues day and Thursday. Long-term travel planning turns me off and can be expensive if plans change, so I opt for purchasing all tickets in the la st four or five da ys prior to target departure. The value of empty seats is $0 as soon as the flight takes off, so true last-minute seats are cheap. Use Orbitz ( www.orbitz.com ) and www.kayak.com first. Fix the departure and return dates between Tuesday and Thursday. Then look at prices for alternative departure dates each of three days into the past and each of three days into the future. Using the cheapest departure date, do the same with the return dates to find the cheapest combinat ion. Check this price against the fares on the website of the airline itself. Then begin bidding on www.priceline.com at 50% of the better of the two, working up in $50 increments", "until you get a better price or realiz e it\u2019s not possible. 3. Consider buying one ticket to an international hub and then an ongoing ticket with a cheap local airline. If going to Europe on a tight budget, you could get three tickets. One free Southwest ticket (from transferring AMEX points) from CA to JFK, the cheapest ticket to Heathrow in London, a nd then an \u00fcbercheap ticket on either Ryanair or EasyJet to a final destination. I have paid as little as $10 to go from London to Berlin or London to Spain. That is not a typo. Local airlines will often offer seats on flights for just the cost of taxes and gasoline. To Central or South American destinations , I\u2019ll often look at local flights from Panama or international flights from Miami. When More Is Less: Cutting the Clutter Human beings have the capacity to l earn to want almost any conceivable material object. Given, then, the emer gence of a modern industrial culture capable of producing almost anything, the time is ripe for opening the storehouse of infinite need! \u2026 It is the modern Pandora\u2019s box, and its plagues are loose upon the world. \u2014JULES", "HENRY To be free, to be happy and fruitful, can only be attained through sacrifice of many common but overestimated things", "\u2014ROBERT HENRI I k n o w t h e s o n o f o n e d e c a - m i l l i o n a i r e , a personal friend of Bill Gates, who now manages private investments and ranches. He has accumulated an assortment of beautiful homes over the last decade, each with full-time cooks, servants, cleaners, and support staff. How does he feel about having a home in each time zone? It\u2019s a pain in the ass! He feels like he\u2019s worki ng for his staff, who spend more time in his homes than he does. Extended travel is the perfect excuse to reverse the damage of years of consuming as much as you can afford. It\u2019s time to get ri d of clutter disguised as necessities before you drag a five-piece Samsonite set ar ound the world. That is hell on earth. I\u2019m not going to tell you to walk around in a robe and sandals scowling at people who have televisions. I hate that kashi- crunching holier-than-thou stuff. Turning you into a possession-less scribe is not my intention. Let\u2019s face it, though: There are tons of things in", "your home and life that you don\u2019t use, need, or even particularly want. They just came into your life as impulsiv e flotsam and jetsam and never found a good exit. Whether you\u2019re aware of it or not, this clutter creates indeci sion and distractions, consuming attention and making unfettered happiness a real chore. It is impossible to realize how distracting all the crap is\u2014whether porcelain dolls, sports car s, or ragged T-shirts\u2014until you get rid of it. Prior to my 15-month trip, I was stressed a bout how to fit all of my belongings into a 14 x 10-foot rental storage space. Then I r ealized a few things: I would never reread the business magazines I\u2019d saved, I wore the sa me five shirts and four pairs of pants 90% of the time, it was about time for new fu rniture, and I never used the outdoor grill or lawn furniture. Even getting rid of things I never used proved to be like a capitalist short-circuit. It was hard to toss things I had once thought were valuable enough to spend money on. The first ten minutes of sorting through clothing was like choos ing which child of", "mine should live or die. I hadn\u2019t exercised my throwing-out muscles in some time. It was a struggle to put nice Christmas clothing I\u2019d never worn into the \u201cgo\u201d pile and just as hard to separate myself from wo rn and ragged clothing I had for sentimental reasons. Once I\u2019d passed through the first few tough decisions, though, the momentum had been built and it was a breeze. I donate d all of the seldom-worn clothing to Goodwill. The furniture took less than 10 hour s to offload using Craigslist, and though I was paid less than 50% of the retail pr ices for some and nothing for others, who cared? I\u2019d used and abused them for five years and would get a new set when I landed back in the U.S. I gave the grill and lawn furniture to my friend, who lit up like a kid at Christmas. I had made his month. It felt wonderful and I had an extra $300 in pocket change to cover at leas t a few weeks of rent abroad. I created 40% more space in my apartment and hadn\u2019t even grazed the surface. It wasn\u2019t the extra physical space that I", "felt most. It was the extra mental space. It was as if I had 20 mental applications running si multaneously before, and now I had just one or two. My thinking was clearer and I was much, much happier.", "I asked every vagabond interviewee in this book what their one recommendation would be for first-time extended travelers. The answer was unanimous: Take less with you. The overpacking impulse is hard to resist. The solution is to set what I call a \u201csettling fund.\u201d Rather than pack for all co ntingencies, I bring the absolute minimum and allocate $100\u2013300 for purchasin g things after I arrive and as I travel. I no longer take toiletries or more than a week\u2019s wort h of clothing. It\u2019s a blast. Finding shaving cream or a dress shirt overseas can pr oduce an adventure in and of itself. Pack as if you were coming back in one wee k. Here are the bare essentials, listed in order of importance: 1. One week of clothing appropriate to the season, including one semiformal shirt and pair of pants or skirt for cust oms. Think T-shirts, one pair of shorts, and a multipurpose pair of jeans. 2. Backup photocopies or scanned copies of all important documents: health insurance, passport/visa, credit cards, debit cards, etc. 3. Debit cards, credit cards , and $200 worth of small bills in local currency (traveler\u2019s checks are not accepted in most places", "and are a hassle) 4. Small cable bike lock for securing luggage while in transit or in hostels; a small padlock for lockers if needed 5. Electronic dictionaries for target lan guages (book versions are too slow to be of use in conversation) and small grammar guides or texts 6.

The pod of 3,000-pound whales then fell into the depths once again. The narwhals are deep divers\u2014more than 3,000 feet in some cases\u2014so Josh had at least 20 minutes until their reappearance.", "It seemed appropriate that he was with th e na r w hals .

He later became the cofounder of a website that provides customized itineraries to would-be vagabonds. His executive status didn\u2019t lessen his mobile addiction. He wa s as comfortable cutting deals from the over- water bungalows of Bora-Bora as he was in the log cabins of the Swiss Alps. He once took a call from a client while at Camp Muir on Mt. Rainier. The client needed to confirm some sales numbers a nd asked Josh about all the wind in the background. Josh\u2019s answer: \u201cI\u2019m standi ng at 10,000 feet on a glacier and this afternoon the wind is whipping us down the mo untain.\u201d The client said he\u2019d let Josh get back to what he was doing. Another client called Josh while he was leaving a Balinese temple and heard the gongs in the background. The client asked Josh if he was in church. Josh wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say. All that came out was, \u201cYes?\u201d Back among the narwhals, Josh had a few minutes before heading to base camp to avoid polar bears.

Making the jump and entering the new worlds that await is like upgrading y our role in life from passenger to pilot. The bulk of this Q&A will focus on the pr ecise steps that you should take\u2014and the countdown timeline you can use\u2014when preparin g for your first mini-retirement. Most steps can be eliminated or condensed on ce you get one trip under your belt. Some of the steps are one-time events, after which subsequent mini-retirements will require a maximum of two to three weeks of prepar ation. It now takes me three afternoons. Grab a pencil and paper\u2014this will be fun. 1. Take an asset and cash-flow snapshot . Set two sheets of paper on a table. Use one t o r e c o r d a l l a s s e ts and corresponding values, including bank accounts, retirement accounts, stocks, bonds, home, and so forth. On the second, draw a line down the middle and write down all incoming cash flow (salary, muse income, investment i n c o m e , e", "t c . ) a n d o u t g o i n g e x p e n s e s (mortgage, rent, car payments, etc.). What can you eliminate that is either seldom used or that creates stress or distract ion without adding a lot of value? 2. Fear-set a one-year mini-retiremen t in a dream location in Europe . Use the questions from chapter 3 t o e v a l u a t e y o u r w o r s t - case-scenario fears and evaluate the real potential consequences. Except in rare cases, most will be avoidable and the rest will be reversible. 3. Choose a location for your actual mini-retirement. Where to start? This is the big question. There ar e two options that I advocate: 1. Choose a starting point and then wa nder until you find your second home. This is what I did with a one-way ticket to London, va gabonding throughout Europe until I fell in love with Berlin, where I remained for three months. 2. Scout a region and then sett le in your favorite spot. Th is is what I did with a tour of", "Central and South America, wh ere I spent one to four weeks in each of several cities, after which I returned to my favorite\u2014Buenos Aires\u2014for six months. It is possible to take a mini-retirement in your own country, but t h e t r a n s f o r m a t i v e effect is hampered if you are surrounde d by people who carry the same socially reinforced baggage. I recommend choosing an overseas location that will seem foreign but that isn\u2019t dangerous. I box, race motorcycles, and do all sorts of macho things, but I draw the line at favelas ,76 civilians with m achine guns, pedestrians w ith m achetes, and social strife. Cheap is good, but bullet holes are bad. Check the U.S. Department of State for travel warnings before booking ti ckets (http:// travel.state.gov).", "Here are just a few of my favorite star ting points. Feel free to choose other locations. The most lifestyle for the dollar is underlined: Argentina (Buenos Aires, C\u00f3rdoba), China (Shanghai, Hong Kong, Ta ipei), Japan (Tokyo, Osaka), England (London), Ireland (Galway), Thailand (Ba ngkok, Chiang Mai), Germany (Berlin, Munich), Norway (Oslo), Australia (S ydney), New Zealand (Queenstown), Italy (Rome, Milan, Florence), Spain (Madri d, Valencia, Sevilla), and Holland (Amsterdam). In all of these places, it is possible to live well while spending little. I spend less in Tokyo than in California because I know it well. Hip, recently gentrified artist areas, not unlike the Brooklyn of 10 y ears ago, can be found in almost all cities. The one place I can\u2019t seem to find a decent lunch for less than $20 U.S.? London. Here are a few exotic places I don\u2019t recommend for vagabonding virgins, though veterans can make them all work: all countri es in Africa, the Middle East, or Central and South America (excepting Costa Rica an d Argentina). Mexico City and Mexican border areas are also a bit too kidnap-h appy to make it onto my favorites list. 4. Prepare for your trip. Here\u2019s the", "countdown . Three months out\u2014Eliminate Get used to minimalism before the departur e. Here are the quest ions to ask and act upon, even if you never plan to leave: What is the 20% of my belongings that I use 80% of the time? Eliminate the other 80% in clothing, magazines, books, and all else. Be ruthle ss\u2014you can always repurchase things you can\u2019t live without. Which belongings create stress in my life? This could relate to maintenance costs (money and energy), insurance, monthly expenses, time consumption, or simple distraction. Eliminate, eliminate, eliminate. If you sell even a few expensive items, it could finance a good portion of your mini-retirement. Don\u2019t rule out the car and home. It\u2019s always possible to purchase either upon your return, often losing no money in the process. Check current health insurance coverage for extended overseas travel. Get the wheels in motion to rent, sw ap, or sell your home\u2014renti ng out is most recommended by serial vagabonds\u2014or end your apartment lease and move all belongings into storage. In all cases where doubts crop up, ask yourself, \u201cIf I had a gun to my head and had to do it, how would I do it?\u201d", "It\u2019s not as hard as you think. Two months out\u2014Automate After eliminating the excess, contact companies (includi ng suppliers) that bill you regularly and set up autopayment with credit cards that have reward points. Telling them that you will be traveling the world for a year often persuades them to accept credit cards rather than chase you aro und the planet like Carmen Sandiego.", "For the credit card companies themselves an d others that refuse, arrange automatic debit from your checking account. Set up online banking and bill payment. Set up all companies that won\u2019t take credit cards or automatic debit as online payees. Set these scheduled checks for $15\u201320 more than expected when dealing with utilities and other variable expenses. This will cover miscellaneous fees, prevent time-consuming billing problems, and accrue as a credit. Cancel p a p e r b a n k a n d c r e d i t c a r d s t a t e m e n t delivery. Get bank-issued credit cards for all checking accounts\u2014generally one for business and one for personal\u2014and set the ca sh advances to $0 to minimize abuse potential. Leave these cards at home, as they are just for emergency overdraft protection. Give a trusted member of your family and/or your accountant power of attorney,77 which gives that person authority to si gn documents (tax filings and checks, for example) in your name. Nothing screws up foreign fun faster than having to sign original documents when faxes are unacceptable. One month out\u2014 Speak to the manager of your local", "post offi ce and have all mail forwarded to a friend, family member, or personal assistant,78who will be paid $100\u2013200 per month to e- mail you brief descriptions of all nonjunk mail each Monday. Get all required and recommended immuni zations and vaccinations for your target region. Check the Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention (www.cdc.gov/travel/). Note that proof of immunizations is sometimes required to pass through foreign customs. Set up a trial account with GoToMyPC or si milar remote-access software and take a dry run to ensure that there are no technological glitches.79 If resellers (or distribut ors) still send you checks\u2014the fulfillment house should handle customer checks at this point\u2014do one of three things: give the resellers direct bank deposit information (ideal), have the fulfillment house handle these checks (second choice), or have the resellers pay via Pa yPal or mail checks to one of the people you are trusting with power of attorney (far third). In the last case, give the person with power of attorney deposit slips so he or she can sign or stamp and mail in the checks. It is convenient to become a member of a la rge bank (Bank of America,", "Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual, Citibank, etc.) with branches near the person assisting you so that they can drop off the deposits wh ile running other errands. No need to move all accounts to this bank if you don\u2019t want to; just open a single new account that is used solely for these deposits. Two weeks out\u2014 Scan all identification, health insurance, and credit/debit cards into a computer from which you can print multiple copies, several to be left with family members and several to be taken with you in separate ba gs. E-mail the scanned file to yourself so that you can access it while abroad if you lose the paper copies.", "If you are an entrepreneur, downgrade your cell phone to the ch eapest plan and set up a voicemail greeting that states, \u201cI am currently overseas on business. Please do not leave a voicemail, as I will not be checking it while gone. Please send me an e-mail at __@__.com if the matter is important. Th ank you for your understanding.\u201d Then set up e-mail autoresponders that indicate res ponses could take up to seven days (or whatever you decide for frequency) due to international business travel. If you are an employee, consider getti ng a quad-band or GSM-compatible cell phone so that the boss can contact you.

Othe r options include using a SkypeIn account that forwards to your fore ign cell phone (my preference) or a Vonage IP box that allows you to receive landline calls anywhere in the world via a phone number that begins w ith your home area code. Find an apartment for your ultimate mini-retirement destination or reserve a", "hostel or hotel at your starting point for three to four days. Reserving an apartment before you arrive is riskier and will be much more expensive than using the latter three to four days to find an apartment. I recomme nd hostels for the starting point if possible\u2014 not for cost considerations but because the staff and fellow travelers are more knowledgeable and helpful with relocations. Get foreign medical evacuation insurance if needed for peace of mind. This tends to be redundant if you are in a first-worl d country and can buy local insurance to augment your own, which I do, an d it is useless if you ar e a 10-hour flight from civilization. I had evacuation insurance in Panama, as it\u2019s a 2-hour flight from Miami, but I didn\u2019t bother elsewhere. Don\u2019t freak out about this; it\u2019s just as true if you\u2019re in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the U.S. One week out\u2014 Decide on a schedule for routine batched tasks such as e-mail, online banking, etc. to eliminate excuses for senseless pseudo- work procrasterbating. I suggest Monday mornings for checking e-mail and online banki ng. The first and third Mondays of the month", "can be used for checking credit card s and making other online payments such as affiliates.

Filling the Void ADDING LIFE AFTER SUBTRACTING WORK To be engrossed by something outside ourselves is a powerful antidote for the rational mind, the mind that so freque ntly has its head up its own ass. \u2014ANNE LAMOTT, Bird by Bird There is not enough time to do all the nothing we want to do. \u2014BILL WATTERSON, creator of the Calvin and Hobbes cartoon strip KING\u2019S CROSS , LONDON"]}, "chapter 15": {"name": "Filling the Void", "text": ["I s t u m b l e d i n t o t h e d e l i a c r o s s t h e c o b b l e s tone street and ordered a prosciutto sandwich.

Thirty minutes earlier, I ha d woken up without an alarm clock for the first time in four years, fresh off arriving from JFK the night before. I had soooo been looking forward to it: awakening to musical birdsong outside, sit ting up in bed with a smile, smelling the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and stretching out overhead like a cat in the shade of a Spanish villa.

Postpartum Depression: It\u2019s Normal Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another. \u2014ANATOLE FRANCE , author of The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard I\u2019ve Got More Money and Time Than I Ever Dreamed Possible \u2026 Why Am I Depressed? It\u2019s a good question with a good answer. Just be glad you\u2019re figuring this out now and not at the end of life! The retired and ultrarich are often unfulfilled and neurotic for the same reason: too", "much idle time. But wait a second \u2026 Isn\u2019t more time what we \u2019re after? Isn\u2019t that what this book is all about? No, not at all. T oo much free time is no more th an fertilizer for self-doubt and assorted mental tail-chasing. Subtra cting the bad does not c r e a t e t h e g o o d . I t leaves a vacuum. Decreasing income-driven work isn\u2019t the end goal. Living more\u2014 and becoming more\u2014is. In the beginning, the external fantasies will be enough, and there is nothing wrong with this. I cannot overemphasize the importa nce of this period. Go nuts and live your dreams. This is not superficial or selfish. It is critical to stop repressing yourself and get out of the postponement habit. Let\u2019s suppose you decide to dip your toe in dreams like relocati ng to the Caribbean for island-hopping or taking a safari in the Serengeti.

There will come a time, however\u2014be it three weeks or three years later\u2014wh en you won\u2019t be able to dr ink another pi\u00f1a colada or photograph another damn red-assed baboon. Self-criticism and existential panic attacks start around this time. But This Is What I Always Wanted! How Can I Be Bored?! Don\u2019t freak out and fuel the fire. This is normal among all high-performers who downshift after working hard for a long time. The smarter and more goal-oriented you are, the tougher these growing pains will be. Learning to replace the perception of time famine with appreciation of time abundanc e is like going from triple espressos to decaf. But there\u2019s more! Retirees get depre ssed for a second reason, and you will too: social isolation. Offices are good for some things: free bad coffee and complaining thereof, gossip and commiserating, stupid video clips via e-mail with even stupider comments, and meetings that accomplish nothing but kill a few hours with a few laughs. The job itself might be a dead end, but it\u2019s the we b of human interactions\u2014the social environment\u2014that keeps us there. Once liberated, this automatic tribal unit disappears, which makes", "the voices in your head louder. Don\u2019t be afraid of the existential or social challenges. Freedom is like a new sport. In the beginning, the sheer ne wness of it is exciting enough to keep things interesting at all times. Once you have learned the basics , though, it becomes clea r that to be even a half-decent player requires some serious practice. Don\u2019t fret. The greatest rewards are to come , and you\u2019re 10 feet from the finish line. Frustrations and Doubts: You\u2019re Not Alone People say that what we are seeking is a meaning for life. I don\u2019t think this is what we\u2019re really seeking.

Without the distrac tion of deadlines and co-workers, the big questions (such as \u201cWha t does it all mean?\u201d) become harder to fend off for a later time. In a sea of infin ite options, decisions also become harder\u2014 What the hell should I do with my life? It\u2019s", "like senior year in college all over again. Like all innovators ahead of the curve, you will ha ve frightening moments of doubt. Once past the kid-in-a-candy-store phase, th e comparative impulse will creep in. The rest of the world will continue with its 9\u20135 grind, and you\u2019ll begin to question your", "decision to step off the treadmill. Comm on doubts and self-flagellation include the following: 1. Am I really doing this to be more free and lead a better life, or am I just lazy? 2. Did I quit the rat race be cause it\u2019s bad, or just be cause I couldn\u2019t hack it? Did I just cop out? 3. Is this as good as it gets? Perhaps I was better off when I was following orders and ignorant of the possibil ities. It was easi er at least. 4. Am I really successful or just kidding myself? 5. Have I lowered my standards to make myself a winner? Are my friends, who are now making twice as much as three years ago, really on the right track? 6. Why am I not happy? I can do anythi ng and I\u2019m still not happy. Do I even deserve it? Most of this can be overcome as soon as we recognize it for what it is: outdated comparisons using the more-is-better and mone y-as-success mind-sets that got us into trouble to begin with. Even so, there is a more profound observation to be made. These doubts invade the mind when nothing el", "se fills it. Think of a time when you felt 100% alive and undistracte d\u2014in the zone. Chances are that it was when you were completely focused in the moment on something external: someone or something else. Sports and sex are two great examples. L acking an external focus, the mind turns inward on itself and creates problems to solv e, even if the problems are undefined or unimportant. If you find a focus, an ambiti ous goal that seems impossible and forces you to grow,81 these doubts disappear. In the process of searching for a new focu s, it is almost inevitable that the \u201cbig\u201d questions will creep in. Ther e is pressure from pseudo- philosophers everywhere to cast aside the impertin ent and answer the eternal. Tw o popular examples are \u201cWhat is the meaning of life?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the point of it all?\u201d There are many more, ranging from the intr ospective to the ont ological, but I have one answer for almost all of th em\u2014I don\u2019t answer them at all. I\u2019m no nihilist.

It is, bar none, th e best thing you can do to hone clear thinking. Quite aside from the fact that it is impossible to understand a culture without understanding its language, acquiring a new language ma kes you aware of your own language: your own thoughts. The benefits of becoming fluent in a foreign tongue are as underestimated as the difficulty is overe stimated. Thousands of theoretical linguists will disagree, but I know from research and personal expe rimentation with more than a dozen languages that (1) adults can l earn languages much faster than children83 when constant 9\u20135 work is remove d and that (2) it is possibl e to become conversationally fluent in any language in six months or less. At four hours per day, six months can be whittled down to less than three months.

Morality is simply the attitude we ad opt toward people we personally dislike. \u2014OSCAR WILDE O ne would expect me to mention service in this chapter, and here it is. Like all before it, the twist is a bit different. Serv ice to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own. This is not the same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-bei ng of mankind\u2014human life. Human life has long been focused on the exclusion of the environm ent and the rest of the food chain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for the betterment and multiplication of mankind. Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice: Do not become a cause snob. How can you help starving children in Africa", "when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How can you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer research on coral destruction help those people who need help now? Children, please. Everything out there n eeds help, so don\u2019t get baited into \u201cmy cause can beat up your cause\u201d arguments with no right answer. There are no", "qualitative or quantitative comparisons that m a k e s e n s e . T h e t r u t h i s t h i s : T h o s e thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions, or that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are unknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you\u2019re improving the world\u2014however you define that\u2014consider your job well done. Service isn\u2019t limited to saving lives or the environment either. It can also improve life. If you are a musician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor and cha nge the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life in the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives. Service is an attitude. Find the cause or vehicle that inte rests you most and make no apologies.

The next step\u2014and that \u2019s all it is\u2014is pu rsuing something, it matters little what, that seem s fun or rewarding. Don\u2019t be in a rush to jump into a full- time long-term commitment. Take time to find something that calls to you, not just the first acceptable form of surrogate work. That calling will, in turn, lead you to something else. Here is a good sequence for ge tting started that dozens of NR have used with success. 1. Revisit ground zero: Do nothing .

It is hard to re calibrate your internal clock without taking a break from constant overstimulation. Travel and the impulse to see a million things can exacerbate this.", "Slowing down doesn\u2019t mean accomplishing less; it means cutting out counterproductive dist ractions and the perception of being rushed.

Make an anonymous donation to th e service organization of your choice . This helps to get the juices flowing and disassociate feeling good about service with getting credit for it. It feels even better wh en it\u2019s pure. Here are some good sites to get started: Charity Navigator ( www.charitynavigator.org ) This independent service ranks more than 5,000 charities using cr iteria you select.

Network for Good ( www.networkforgood.org ) Visitors to this website will find links to charities in need of donations as well as opportunities to do volunteer work. They can also set up an automated credit card donation online. 3. Take a learning mini-retirement in c o m b i n a t i o n w i t h l o c a l v o l u n t e e r i n g . Take a mini-retirement\u2014six months or mo re if possible\u2014to focus on learning and serving. The longer duration will permit a langua ge focus, which in turn enables more meaningful interaction and c ontribution through volunteering. For the duration of this tri p, note self-criticisms and nega tive self-talk in a journal. Whenever", "upset or anxious, ask \u201cwhy\u201d at least three times and put the answers down on paper. Describing these doubts in writing re duces their impact twofold. First, it\u2019s often the ambiguous nature of self-doubt that hurts most. Defining and exploring it in", "writing\u2014just as with forcing colleagues to e-mail\u2014demands clarity of thought, after which most concerns are found to be ba seless. Second, record ing these concerns seems to somehow remove them from your head. But where to go and what to do? There is no one right answer to either. Use the following questions and resources to brainstorm: What makes you most angry about the state of the world? What are you most afraid of for the ne xt generation, whether you have children or not? What makes you happiest in your life? How can you help others have the same? There is no need to limit yourself to one location. Remember Robin, who traveled through South America for a year with her husband and seven-year-old son? The three of them spent one to two months doing volunteer work in each location, including building wheelchairs in Banos, Ecuador, reha bilitating exotic animals in the Bolivian rain forest, and shepherding leathe r-back sea turtles in Suriname. How about doing archaeological excavation in Jordan or tsunami relief on the islands of Thailand?

Revisit and reset dreamlines . Following the mini-retirement, re visit the dreamlines set in Definition and reset them as needed. The following questions will help: What are you good at?", "What could you be the best at? What makes you happy? What excites you? What makes you feel accomp lished and good about yourself? What are you most proud of having accomplis hed in your life? Can you repeat this or further develop it? What do you enjoy sharing or e xperiencing with other people? 5. Based on the outcomes of steps 1\u20134, consider testing new part- or full-time vocations . Full-time work isn\u2019t bad if it\u2019s what you\u2019d rather be doing. This is where we distinguish \u201cwork\u201d from a \u201cvocation.\u201d If you have created a muse or cut your hours down to next to nothing, consider testing a part-time or full-time vocation: a true calling or dream occupation. This is what I did with this book. I can now tell pe ople I\u2019m a writer rather than giving them the two-hour drug dealer expl anation. What did you dream of being when you were a kid? Perhaps it\u2019s time to sign up for Space Camp or intern as an assistant to a marine biologist. Recapturing the excitement of childhood is n\u2019t impossible. In fact, it\u2019s required.
